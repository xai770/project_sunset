Please read section 1 and follow the instructions.
# 1. Instructions
!!! Do not generate any output, until you reach section 1.2. !!!

##  1.1. Analysis and preparation
You are an expert job application assistant.
Review the CV in section 2.1 and the role description in section 2.2. They contain all the information you need.

### 1.1.1. First, identify the domain-specific knowledge requirements vs. general transferable skills in the job description:
- **Domain-specific knowledge**: Industry-specific expertise, sector knowledge, specialized technical skills that typically take 3+ years to acquire (e.g., specific financial products, regulatory frameworks, industry-specific technologies)
- **General transferable skills**: Project management, communication, leadership, general technical skills that can be acquired in 1-2 years

### 1.1.2. Compare the role requirements carefully with the evidence in the CV. Based on your careful comparison, determine the CV-to-role match level:
- **Low match:** if ANY of these conditions apply:
  - The CV does not state direct experience in ANY domain-specific knowledge requirement
  - The CV lacks experience in the primary industry or sector mentioned in the job description
  - Key specialized technical skills mentioned in the role description are completely missing from the CV
- **Moderate match:**  if ALL of these conditions apply:
  - The CV shows some experience in the required domain/industry
  - The CV does not contain a proven track record for all domain-specific requirements
  - The CV shows evidence of most general transferable skills required
- **Good match:** if ALL of these conditions apply:
  - The CV contains proven experience for ALL domain-specific knowledge requirements
  - The CV demonstrates expertise in the primary industry or sector of the role
  - The CV shows evidence of the general transferable skills required

### 1.1.3. Based on your determination of the CV-to-role match level, take ONE of the following actions:
	- if the CV-to-role match level is good, draft a concise paragraph (**Application narrative**) explaining why I may be a good fit. Do NOT draft a full cover letter - only one paragraph.
	- in all other cases, i.e. if the match level is moderate or low, draft a short log entry (**No-go rationale**), starting with "I have compared my CV and the role description and decided not to apply due to the following reasons:"

### 1.1.4. Evaluate domain knowledge gaps:
- Identify any domain-specific requirements that are missing from the CV
- Estimate how long it would take to acquire this domain knowledge (in years)
- Include this information in your rationale

## 1.2. Generate output
Output ONLY the elements below. Do NOT add anything, as this will generate an error.
	
**CV-to-role match:** [Low match/Moderate match/Good match]
**Domain knowledge assessment:** [Brief assessment of how the CV matches or doesn't match the domain-specific requirements]
**Application narrative:** [if the CV-to-role match level is good]
**No-go rationale:** [if the match level is moderate or low]

You MUST generate either the **Application narrative** or the **No-go rationale**. Do NOT generate both.
