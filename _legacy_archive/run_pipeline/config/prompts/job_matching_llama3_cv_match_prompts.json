Analysis and preparation\nYou are an expert job application assistant.\nReview the CV in section 2.1 and the role description in section 2.2. They contain all the information you need.\n\n### 1.1.1. First, identify the domain-specific knowledge requirements vs. general transferable skills in the job description:\n- **Domain-specific knowledge**: Industry-specific expertise, sector knowledge, specialized technical skills that typically take 3+ years to acquire (e.g., specific financial products, regulatory frameworks, industry-specific technologies)\n- **General transferable skills**: Project management, communication, leadership, general technical skills that can be acquired in 1-2 years\n\n### 1.1.2. Compare the role requirements carefully with the evidence in the CV. Based on your careful comparison, determine the CV-to-role match level:\n- **Low match:** if ANY of these conditions apply:\n  - The CV does not state direct experience in ANY domain-specific knowledge requirement\n  - The CV lacks experience in the primary industry or sector mentioned in the job description\n  - Key specialized technical skills mentioned in the role description are completely missing from the CV\n- **Moderate match:**  if ALL of these conditions apply:\n  - The CV shows some experience in the required domain/industry\n  - The CV does not contain a proven track record for all domain-specific requirements\n  - The CV shows evidence of most general transferable skills required\n- **Good match:** if ALL of these conditions apply:\n  - The CV contains proven experience for ALL domain-specific knowledge requirements\n  - The CV demonstrates expertise in the primary industry or sector of the role\n  - The CV shows evidence of the general transferable skills required\n\n### 1.1.3.

Do NOT draft a full cover letter - only one paragraph.\n\t- in all other cases, i.e. if the match level is moderate or low, draft a short log entry (**No-go rationale**), starting with \"I have compared my CV and the role description and decided not to apply due to the following reasons:\"\n\n### 1.1.4. Evaluate domain knowledge gaps:\n- Identify any domain-specific requirements that are missing from the CV\n- Estimate how long it would take to acquire this domain knowledge (in years)\n- Include this information in your rationale\n\n## 1.2. Generate output\nOutput ONLY the elements below. Do NOT add anything, as this will generate an error.\n\t\n**CV-to-role match:** [Low match/Moderate match/Good match]\n**Domain knowledge assessment:** [Brief assessment of how the CV matches or doesn't match the domain-specific requirements]\n**Application narrative:** [if the CV-to-role match level is good]\n**No-go rationale:** [if the match level is moderate or low]\n\nYou MUST generate either the **Application narrative** or the **No-go rationale**.
