--- FINAL LLM RESPONSE (Lowest Match Level) ---

**CV-to-role match:** Low match
**Domain knowledge assessment:** The CV shows some experience in the required domain/industry (banking and finance), but lacks proven track record for all domain-specific requirements (collateral management, currency swaps). The CV demonstrates expertise in general transferable skills required (project management, leadership, communication).
**No-go rationale:** I have compared my CV and the role description and decided not to apply due to the following reasons: 
- The CV does not state direct experience in collateral management or currency swaps.
- The CV lacks experience in the specific industry/sector of the Collateral Management Analyst role (banking and finance).
- Key specialized technical skills mentioned in the role description are completely missing from the CV.

**Domain knowledge assessment:** Although the CV contains some experience in financial planning and governance, software license management, and contract compliance, it lacks specific expertise in private banking, wealth management, and business management. Acquiring relevant domain-specific knowledge would take approximately 1-2 years.
**No-go rationale:** Although I have relevant experience in financial planning and governance, software license management, and contract compliance, my background is not directly aligned with the Private Bank - Business Manager role. Additionally, acquiring the necessary domain-specific knowledge for this position would require significant time and effort, which may be challenging to accomplish within a short timeframe.

**CV-to-role match:** Low match
**Domain knowledge assessment:** The role description requires domain-specific knowledge in the capital markets industry, specifically in clearing and settlement processes. However, the CV provides extensive experience in software license management and compliance, which is not directly related to the capital markets industry. While some transferable skills like problem-solving and decision-making are mentioned, they are not sufficient to match the role requirements.
**No-go rationale:** I have compared my CV and the role description and decided not to apply due to the following reasons: The CV does not provide direct experience in clearing and settlement processes, which are critical to this role. While some transferable skills like problem-solving and decision-making are mentioned, they are not sufficient to match the role requirements.

**CV-to-role match:** Low match
**Domain knowledge assessment:** Domain-specific requirements in software license management are missing from the CV, such as comprehensive analysis of major compliance cases (Interwoven, SAS, SAP), and contract negotiations. Estimated time to acquire this domain knowledge: 1-2 years.
**No-go rationale:** I have compared my CV and the role description and decided not to apply due to the following reasons: [Extracted from incorrectly formatted narrative: Although my experience in managing global IT category governance with 15+ team members is similar to the required skills for this role, I lack specific expertise in software automation testing and GCP Cloud logs analysis. My experience as a Software Category Manager at Deutsche Bank AG also demonstrates my ability to negotiate strategic vendor agreements, which aligns with the importance of collaboration with global stakeholders and business partners in this role.]
