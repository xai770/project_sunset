# JMFS Pipeline Modular Structure

## Overview
The JMFS (Job Finding and Matching System) pipeline has been redesigned with a modular architecture to improve maintainability, readability, and extensibility. This document outlines the new structure and how components interact.

## Core Components

### `pipeline_orchestrator.py`
The main entry point that coordinates all pipeline steps. It has been significantly reduced in size by moving functionality to specialized modules.

### `job_scanner.py`
Handles discovery of new or missing jobs in the system. Contains:
- `run_job_scanner()`: Main function to scan for jobs based on configured ranges
- `reset_progress_tracker()`: Utility to reset the job scan progress tracker

### `job_matcher.py`
Manages the job matching process using LLM (llama3.2). Contains:
- `run_job_matcher()`: Processes jobs and generates match results and cover letter content

### `feedback_loop.py`
Handles all functionality related to the JMFS feedback loop (steps 7-10). Contains:
- `run_excel_export_step()`: Exports job matches to Excel
- `run_cover_letter_generation_step()`: Generates cover letters for good matches
- `run_email_delivery_step()`: Emails Excel and cover letters to reviewers
- `run_feedback_processing_step()`: Processes returned feedback
- `execute_feedback_loop()`: Orchestrates all feedback loop steps

### `test_integration.py`
Provides utilities for testing the pipeline. Contains:
- `process_force_good_matches()`: Forces specific jobs to have 'Good' matches for testing

### `test_utils.py`
Contains low-level test utilities. Contains:
- `force_good_match_for_testing()`: Creates an artificial "Good" match for a specific job

## Component Interactions

1. `run_pipeline.py` calls `run_pipeline()` from `pipeline_orchestrator.py`
2. `pipeline_orchestrator.py` calls component functions in sequence:
   - Process forced good matches with `process_force_good_matches()`
   - Run job scanner with `run_job_scanner()`
   - Run job matcher with `run_job_matcher()`
   - Execute feedback loop with `execute_feedback_loop()`

## Testing

A dedicated test script (`test_modular_structure.py`) has been created to test the new modular structure. It verifies that:
- The pipeline can be run with the new modular components
- Job scanning works correctly
- Job matching generates correct results
- Cover letters are generated for "Good" matches
- The feedback loop functions properly

## Benefits of Modular Structure

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and maintain
2. **Testability**: Individual components can be tested independently
3. **Extensibility**: New features can be added to specific modules without affecting others
4. **Readability**: Code is organized by function, making it easier to navigate
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more unit tests for individual components
2. Create a configuration system to centralize pipeline settings
3. Add logging controls to adjust verbosity by component
4. Develop a dashboard to monitor pipeline performance
