# Feedback Loop for Job Matching LLM

## Problem

When the LLM makes an incorrect match (e.g., says you are a good fit for a job you are not), we want a simple way to provide feedback and have the system learn from it, ideally without manual rule-writing.

## Simple Solution (MVP)

- Add a 'Feedback' column to the exported Excel/CSV sheet.
- User marks matches as 'Incorrect', 'Not a good fit', or provides a short reason.
- The system reads this feedback and, for each rejected match, sends the original LLM input, output, and feedback to the LLM (Ollama) for analysis.
- The LLM is prompted: "The following match was marked as incorrect by the user. Please analyze why and suggest how to avoid this mistake in the future."
- Optionally, the LLM can be asked to update its prompt or matching logic, or to generate a list of skills/requirements to avoid in future matches.

## Can the LLM Learn from Feedback Like Machine Learning?

- **Yes, to a degree.**
- If you provide the LLM with examples of incorrect matches and your feedback, it can:
  - Analyze patterns in its mistakes
  - Suggest prompt changes or new rules
  - Generate a list of skills/roles to avoid
- This is not true "machine learning" (no weights are updated), but it is a form of *in-context learning* or *prompt engineering*.
- For more persistent learning, you would need to fine-tune the LLM on your feedback data, or maintain an exclusion list/ruleset that is always referenced in the prompt.

## Could Embeddings Help?

- Embeddings could be used to:
  - Find similar jobs you previously rejected, and warn the LLM or user
  - Cluster jobs/skills you tend to reject, and use this as negative context
- This is more advanced, but can be layered on top of the simple feedback loop.

## Magic?

- There is no magic, but LLMs are surprisingly good at learning from a handful of negative examples if you include them in the prompt or as context.
- For best results, keep a running list of rejected matches and reasons, and feed this to the LLM as part of the prompt or as a separate context file.

## Implemented Solution

The feedback loop has been implemented with the following components:

1. **Feedback Collection**: 
   - Every job match export now includes a 'Feedback' column for user comments
   - Users can mark matches as incorrect or provide specific feedback
   
2. **Feedback Processing**:
   - The `process_feedback.py` script analyzes feedback from exported Excel files
   - `job_matcher.feedback_handler` processes individual feedback entries
   - Feedback is sent to the LLM for analysis via the feedback API endpoint

3. **Prompt Improvement**:
   - The system can automatically update prompts based on feedback analysis
   - `add_prompt_version()` creates new prompt versions with improvements
   - Updated prompts are tagged with feedback information for tracking

4. **Testing Framework**:
   - `test_feedback_loop.py` verifies individual components
   - `test_integrated_feedback.py` tests the entire feedback cycle
   - `test_feedback_system.py` provides comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps

1. Implement clustering of similar feedback to identify patterns
2. Add a feedback dashboard to visualize improvement over time
3. Consider incorporating embeddings to find similar rejected jobs
