# VS Code and Pyright Configuration Fix

## Issue

VS Code was showing warnings in the settings.json file about settings that cannot be overridden when a pyrightconfig.json file is present:

1. `python.analysis.extraPaths`
2. `python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides`
3. `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode`

This happens because Pyright configuration in VS Code follows a hierarchy:
1. pyrightconfig.json (highest priority)
2. pyproject.toml
3. settings.json (lowest priority)

When both files define the same settings, the pyrightconfig.json takes precedence and VS Code complains about the redundant settings.

## Solution

1. Removed the conflicting settings from `.vscode/settings.json`:
   - Removed `python.analysis.extraPaths`
   - Removed `python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides`
   - Removed `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode`

2. Made sure these settings are properly configured in `pyrightconfig.json`:
   - Added `/home/xai/Documents/sunset` to `extraPaths`
   - Kept the existing diagnostic severity overrides that silence import warnings
   - Kept the `typeCheckingMode` setting as "basic"

## Benefits

1. **No More Warnings:** The warning messages in VS Code will no longer appear.

2. **Single Source of Truth:** Having these settings in a single location (pyrightconfig.json) makes maintenance easier.

3. **Better Compatibility:** This follows the recommended practice for Pyright configuration.

4. **Project Portability:** pyrightconfig.json is a standard file for Python projects and will work with other editors and tools that support Pyright.

## Additional Notes

- The mypy configuration remains in the `.vscode/settings.json` file because it's specific to the VS Code mypy extension.
- The Python interpreter path also remains in settings.json as it's a VS Code-specific setting.
- If you need to modify Pyright settings in the future, make the changes in the pyrightconfig.json file.
