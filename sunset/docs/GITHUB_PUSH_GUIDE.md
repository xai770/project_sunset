# GitHub Publication Guide - Project Sunset

## 🎯 Repository Ready for Publication!

Your codebase has been cleaned up and is ready to be published to GitHub. All sensitive files have been removed from tracking.

## Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `project-sunset` (recommended) or `sunset-job-automation`
3. **Description**: 
   ```
   AI-powered job application automation system with LLM-based skill matching, professional cover letter generation, and comprehensive job analysis pipeline.
   ```
4. **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private (Public recommended for portfolio)
5. **Important**: ❌ Do NOT check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. **Important**: ❌ Do NOT check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
7. **Important**: ❌ Do NOT check "Choose a license" (can add later)
8. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect and Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these instead:

```bash
cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Switch to main branch (GitHub default)
git checkout main || git checkout -b main

# Merge your latest changes into main
git merge job-directory-fix

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Optionally, also push the feature branch
git push origin job-directory-fix
```

## Step 3: Verify Publication
