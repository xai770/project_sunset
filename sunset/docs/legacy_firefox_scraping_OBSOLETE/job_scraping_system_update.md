# Job Scraping System Update

## Overview of Issues Fixed

The job scraping system for Deutsche Bank jobs was experiencing issues where job HTML content wasn't being scraped during the rebuild process. This resulted in placeholder clean descriptions due to Firefox not running during the automation process.

**Original Issues:**
1. Job fetcher was retrieving jobs from all locations despite filtering for Frankfurt (this was already fixed)
2. Job HTML content was not being scraped during the rebuild process
3. The HTML content directory was not always being created
4. Clean descriptions contained placeholders due to Firefox not running during automation

## Key Issues Identified

1. Firefox was required for job scraping but wasn't always running during automated processes
2. The standalone_job_scraper.py script was failing silently when Firefox wasn't available
3. Job description extraction was attempted without having HTML content to work with
4. The workflow was treating the HTML content scraping and job description extraction as separate steps

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Firefox Management

- Added Firefox detection in all relevant scripts
- Implemented automatic Firefox starting if not already running
- Added clear error messages when Firefox is required

### 2. Improved Workflow Integration

- Updated ensure_firefox_and_scrape.sh to handle both HTML scraping and description extraction
- Modified job_description_cleaner.py to check for HTML files if not found in job JSON
- Added proper placeholder descriptions that indicate they need repair

### 3. Repair Functionality

- Created repair_job_descriptions.sh to fix jobs with placeholder descriptions
- The repair script:
  - Checks if Firefox is running
  - Finds jobs without HTML content
  - Scrapes missing HTML content 
  - Extracts clean descriptions
  - Verifies all jobs have proper clean descriptions

## How to Use

### Normal Workflow
The regular job workflow will now automatically:
1. Check if Firefox is running and start it if needed
2. Scrape HTML content properly
3. Extract clean descriptions immediately after scraping

### Repairing Existing Jobs

To fix jobs that already have placeholder descriptions:
```bash
bash scripts/repair_job_descriptions.sh --max-jobs 10
```

You can increase the number of jobs to repair by changing the `--max-jobs` parameter.

## Requirements

- Firefox browser must be installed
- Ollama must be running for job description extraction

## Troubleshooting

If you see placeholder descriptions with the message "The full job description could not be extracted", run:
```bash
python scripts/verify_and_fix_clean_descriptions.py --check-firefox
```

This will check for and attempt to fix any missing descriptions.

Additionally, you can run our test script to verify the overall implementation:
```bash
python scripts/test_job_scraping_implementation.py
```

This will check if:
1. Firefox is currently running
2. HTML content directory exists
3. Jobs have proper descriptions (not placeholders)
4. Repair script is executable
5. Workflow script is using ensure_firefox_and_scrape.sh
