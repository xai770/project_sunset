# Mathematical Framework for Skill Domain Relationships

*A Formal Approach to Quantifying Professional Skill Compatibility*

## Abstract

This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing and quantifying relationships between professional skill domains. We introduce formal definitions for various types of skill domain relationships, including hierarchical, proximity, level, and conceptual relationships. By defining skill domains in terms of their knowledge components, contexts, proficiency levels, and functions, we develop a rigorous approach to calculating skill compatibility and transition pathways. The framework provides both theoretical foundations and practical applications for workforce development, career transitioning, and educational planning.

## 1. Introduction

Understanding relationships between professional skill domains is crucial for workforce planning, education design, and career development. Previous approaches have relied primarily on qualitative assessments or simplistic overlap metrics, lacking mathematical rigor and comprehensive categorization. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a formalized mathematical framework for representing and analyzing skill domain relationships.

## 2. Formal Definitions

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the universal set of all possible skills.

### 2.1 Skill Domain Representation

For any skill domain $A \subset \mathcal{S}$, we define:

- $K(A) = \{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\}$: the set of knowledge components required for skill $A$
- $C(A) = \{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m\}$: the set of contexts in which skill $A$ is applied
- $L(A) \in [0, 10]$: the proficiency level required for skill $A$
- $F(A) = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_p\}$: the set of functions or purposes of skill $A$

### 2.2 Similarity Metrics

For any two sets $X$ and $Y$, we define the Jaccard similarity coefficient:

$$J(X, Y) = \frac{|X \cap Y|}{|X \cup Y|}$$

This provides a normalized measure of set similarity, where $J(X, Y) = 0$ indicates no overlap and $J(X, Y) = 1$ indicates identical sets.

## 3. Relationship Operators

We formalize various skill domain relationships using mathematical operators.

### 3.1 Hierarchical Relationships

**Definition 3.1.1** (Subset Relationship). Skill domain $A$ is a subset of skill domain $B$, denoted $A \subset B$, if:

$$K(A) \subset K(B) \wedge C(A) \subset C(B)$$

Example: Chinese cook $\subset$ Cook

**Definition 3.1.2** (Superset Relationship). Skill domain $B$ is a superset of skill domain $A$, denoted $B \supset A$, if:

$$K(B) \supset K(A) \wedge C(B) \supset C(A)$$

Example: Cook $\supset$ Chinese cook

### 3.2 Proximity Relationships

**Definition 3.2.1** (Adjacency). Skill domains $A$ and $B$ are adjacent, denoted $A \sim B$, if:

$$J(K(A), K(B)) > \theta_{adj} \wedge J(F(A), F(B)) > \theta_{func}$$

where $\theta_{adj}, \theta_{func}$ are threshold parameters.

Example: Accountant $\sim$ Tax specialist

**Definition 3.2.2** (Neighboring). Skill domains $A$ and $B$ are neighboring, denoted $A \approx B$, if:

$$J(C(A), C(B)) > \theta_{neigh} \wedge J(F(A), F(B)) < \theta_{func}$$

Example: Court clerk $\approx$ Police officer

### 3.3 Authority Relationships

**Definition 3.3.1** (Hierarchical Professional). Skill domain $A$ is hierarchically related to skill domain $B$, denoted $A \prec B$, if:

$$J(F(A), F(B)) > \theta_{func} \wedge L(A) < L(B) \wedge \exists k \in K(B) \setminus K(A): k \text{ is an authority component}$$

Example: Paralegal $\prec$ Lawyer

### 3.4 Parallel Relationships

**Definition 3.4.1** (Parallel Specialization). Skill domains $A$ and $B$ are parallel specializations, denoted $A \parallel B$, if:

$$\exists C \in \mathcal{S}: A \subset C \wedge B \subset C \wedge J(K(A), K(B)) < \theta_{par} \wedge |L(A) - L(B)| < \delta_L$$

where $\theta_{par}$ is a threshold parameter and $\delta_L$ is a level difference parameter.

Example: French cook $\parallel$ Japanese cook

### 3.5 Level Relationships

**Definition 3.5.1** (Skill Level Disparity). Skill domains $A$ and $B$ have a skill level disparity, denoted $A \ll B$, if:

$$J(F(A), F(B)) > \theta_{func} \wedge (A \subset B \vee B \subset A) \wedge L(B) - L(A) > \delta_L$$

Example: Kitchen helper $\ll$ Chef

### 3.6 Conceptual Relationships

**Definition 3.6.1** (Analogous). Skill domains $A$ and $B$ are analogous, denoted $A \cong B$, if:

$$\text{structure}(F(A)) \approx \text{structure}(F(B)) \wedge J(C(A), C(B)) < \theta_{context}$$

Example: Job coach $\cong$ Sports coach

**Definition 3.6.2** (Transferable Skills). Skill domain $A$ has transferable skills to domain $B$, denoted $A \rightsquigarrow B$, if:

$$\exists K' \subset K(A): K' \text{ can be applied in } C(B) \wedge \frac{|K'|}{|K(B)|} > \theta_{trans}$$

Example: Military officer $\rightsquigarrow$ Project manager

### 3.7 Additional Relationships

**Definition 3.7.1** (Complementary). Skill domains $A$ and $B$ are complementary, denoted $A \oplus B$, if:

$$\text{value}(A \cup B) > \text{value}(A) + \text{value}(B)$$

Example: UI designer $\oplus$ UX researcher

**Definition 3.7.2** (Evolutionary). Skill domain $A$ has evolved into skill domain $B$, denoted $A \Rightarrow B$, if:

$$J(F(A), F(B)) > \theta_{func} \wedge \text{time}(A) < \text{time}(B) \wedge \text{tech}(A) \prec \text{tech}(B)$$

Example: Typesetter $\Rightarrow$ Digital layout designer

**Definition 3.7.3** (Prerequisite). Skill domain $A$ is a prerequisite for skill domain $B$, denoted $A \triangleright B$, if:

$$K(A) \subset K(B) \wedge \text{acquisition}(A) \text{ necessarily precedes } \text{acquisition}(B)$$

Example: Basic programming $\triangleright$ Machine learning engineering

## 4. Distance Metric

We define a distance function $d: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{S} \to [0,1]$ that satisfies metric properties:

$$d(A, B) = 1 - w_K \cdot J(K(A), K(B)) - w_C \cdot J(C(A), C(B)) - w_L \cdot \frac{\min(L(A), L(B))}{\max(L(A), L(B))} - w_F \cdot J(F(A), F(B))$$

where $w_K, w_C, w_L, w_F$ are weights such that $w_K + w_C + w_L + w_F = 1$.

**Theorem 4.1**. The function $d$ is a valid distance metric satisfying:
1. $d(A, A) = 0$ (identity)
2. $d(A, B) = d(B, A)$ (symmetry)
3. $d(A, C) \leq d(A, B) + d(B, C)$ (triangle inequality)

*Proof*. Omitted for brevity but follows from properties of Jaccard similarity and the normalization of the weighted components.

# 5. Relationship Classification Function

We define a classification function R: S × S → R where R is the set of relationship types.

The relationship R(A, B) is classified according to the following criteria:

| Relationship Type | Condition |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Identical | if d(A, B) = 0 |
| Subset | if A ⊂ B |
| Superset | if A ⊃ B |
| Adjacent | if A ∼ B |
| Neighboring | if A ≈ B |
| Hierarchical Professional | if A ≺ B or B ≺ A |
| Parallel Specialization | if A ∥ B |
| Skill Level Disparity | if A ≪ B or B ≪ A |
| Analogous | if A ≅ B |
| Transferable | if A ⇝ B or B ⇝ A |
| Complementary | if A ⊕ B |
| Evolutionary | if A ⇒ B or B ⇒ A |
| Prerequisite | if A ▷ B or B ▷ A |
| Unrelated | otherwise |

The classification works hierarchically - if multiple conditions could apply, the relationship higher in the list takes precedence. For example, if two skills could be classified as both "Adjacent" and "Transferable," the "Adjacent" classification would be used as it appears earlier in the hierarchy.


## 6. Skill Domain Transformation Functions

We define transformation functions that quantify the difficulty and resources required to transition between skill domains:

**Definition 6.1** (Training Probability). The probability of successful transition from skill domain $A$ to skill domain $B$ through training:

$$T_{prob}(A, B) = \frac{|K(A) \cap K(B)|}{|K(B)|} \cdot \frac{|C(A) \cap C(B)|}{|C(B)|} \cdot \frac{\min(L(A), L(B))}{\max(L(A), L(B))}$$

**Definition 6.2** (Transition Time). The expected time required to transition from skill domain $A$ to skill domain $B$:

$$T_{time}(A, B) = \tau_0 \cdot \frac{|K(B) \setminus K(A)|}{|K(B)|} \cdot \frac{|C(B) \setminus C(A)|}{|C(B)|} \cdot \frac{\max(L(B)-L(A), 0)}{L(B)} \cdot \text{complexity}(B)$$

where $\tau_0$ is a base time unit (e.g., months).

**Definition 6.3** (Transition Cost). The expected cost to transition from skill domain $A$ to skill domain $B$:

$$T_{cost}(A, B) = \kappa_0 \cdot T_{time}(A, B) \cdot \text{cost\_factor}(B)$$

where $\kappa_0$ is a base cost unit.

## 7. Mathematical Properties

**Theorem 7.1** (Transitivity of Subset Relationship). If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset C$, then $A \subset C$.

*Proof*. Follows directly from the transitivity property of set inclusion.

**Theorem 7.2** (Non-Transitivity of Adjacency). $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$ does not necessarily imply $A \sim C$.

*Proof*. By counterexample. Consider domains with knowledge components:
- $K(A) = \{k_1, k_2, k_3\}$
- $K(B) = \{k_3, k_4, k_5\}$
- $K(C) = \{k_5, k_6, k_7\}$

With $\theta_{adj} = 0.2$, we have $J(K(A), K(B)) = 1/5 > \theta_{adj}$ and $J(K(B), K(C)) = 1/5 > \theta_{adj}$, but $J(K(A), K(C)) = 0 < \theta_{adj}$.

**Theorem 7.3** (Symmetry Properties). The following relationships are symmetric:
- Adjacent: If $A \sim B$ then $B \sim A$
- Neighboring: If $A \approx B$ then $B \approx A$
- Parallel Specialization: If $A \parallel B$ then $B \parallel A$
- Analogous: If $A \cong B$ then $B \cong A$
- Complementary: If $A \oplus B$ then $B \oplus A$

*Proof*. Follows from the symmetry of Jaccard similarity and the definitions.

**Theorem 7.4** (Asymmetry Properties). The following relationships are asymmetric:
- Subset/Superset: If $A \subset B$ then $B \not\subset A$ (unless $A = B$)
- Hierarchical Professional: If $A \prec B$ then $B \not\prec A$
- Skill Level Disparity: If $A \ll B$ then $B \not\ll A$
- Evolutionary: If $A \Rightarrow B$ then $B \not\Rightarrow A$
- Prerequisite: If $A \triangleright B$ then $B \not\triangleright A$

*Proof*. Follows from the definitions and the properties of the underlying operators.

## 8. Applications and Examples

### 8.1 Culinary Domain Example

Let us consider the following skill domains in the culinary field:

1. Chef ($C_1$):
   - $K(C_1) = \{$ food science, culinary techniques, menu planning, kitchen management, flavor pairing, cooking methods $\}$
   - $C(C_1) = \{$ restaurant, hotel, catering, food service $\}$
   - $L(C_1) = 8$
   - $F(C_1) = \{$ food preparation, menu creation, kitchen oversight $\}$

2. Kitchen Helper ($C_2$):
   - $K(C_2) = \{$ basic food prep, cleaning, food safety $\}$
   - $C(C_2) = \{$ restaurant, hotel, catering, food service $\}$
   - $L(C_2) = 3$
   - $F(C_2) = \{$ food preparation, kitchen support $\}$

3. French Cook ($C_3$):
   - $K(C_3) = \{$ French cuisine, French techniques, sauce making, culinary techniques, French ingredients $\}$
   - $C(C_3) = \{$ restaurant, hotel, catering $\}$
   - $L(C_3) = 7$
   - $F(C_3) = \{$ food preparation, French menu creation $\}$

4. Japanese Cook ($C_4$):
   - $K(C_4) = \{$ Japanese cuisine, knife skills, raw fish handling, culinary techniques, Japanese ingredients $\}$
   - $C(C_4) = \{$ restaurant, hotel, catering $\}$
   - $L(C_4) = 7$
   - $F(C_4) = \{$ food preparation, Japanese menu creation $\}$

Analysis:
- $C_2 \subset C_1$ (Kitchen Helper is a subset of Chef)
- $C_3 \subset C_1$ and $C_4 \subset C_1$ (French Cook and Japanese Cook are subsets of Chef)
- $C_3 \parallel C_4$ (French Cook and Japanese Cook are parallel specializations)
- $C_2 \ll C_1$ (Kitchen Helper has a skill level disparity with Chef)

### 8.2 Calculation Example: French Cook and Japanese Cook

$$J(K(C_3), K(C_4)) = \frac{|\{culinary techniques\}|}{|\{French cuisine, French techniques, sauce making, culinary techniques, French ingredients, Japanese cuisine, knife skills, raw fish handling, Japanese ingredients\}|} = \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.11$$

$$J(C(C_3), C(C_4)) = \frac{|\{restaurant, hotel, catering\}|}{|\{restaurant, hotel, catering\}|} = 1.0$$

$$J(F(C_3), F(C_4)) = \frac{|\{food preparation\}|}{|\{food preparation, French menu creation, Japanese menu creation\}|} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33$$

$$\frac{\min(L(C_3), L(C_4))}{\max(L(C_3), L(C_4))} = \frac{7}{7} = 1.0$$

With weights $w_K = 0.4, w_C = 0.3, w_L = 0.1, w_F = 0.2$, the distance is:

$$d(C_3, C_4) = 1 - 0.4 \cdot 0.11 - 0.3 \cdot 1.0 - 0.1 \cdot 1.0 - 0.2 \cdot 0.33 \approx 1 - 0.044 - 0.3 - 0.1 - 0.066 = 0.49$$

Since $K(C_3) \cap K(C_4) = \{\text{culinary techniques}\}$ and there exists $C_1$ such that $C_3 \subset C_1$ and $C_4 \subset C_1$ and $J(K(C_3), K(C_4)) = 0.11 < \theta_{par}$ (assuming $\theta_{par} = 0.3$), we classify this as $C_3 \parallel C_4$ (Parallel Specialization).

## 9. Conclusion

This paper has presented a formalized mathematical framework for analyzing relationships between professional skill domains. By defining precise operators and metrics, we enable rigorous classification and quantification of skill domain relationships. This framework provides a foundation for applications in workforce development, educational planning, and career transition analysis.

The framework allows for both theoretical analysis of skill domain properties and practical calculations for real-world skill domains. Future work includes extending the framework to incorporate temporal dynamics of skill evolution, developing efficient algorithms for large-scale skill domain analysis, and integrating machine learning approaches for automated skill domain mapping.
