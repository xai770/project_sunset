# Task-centric LLM Management Framework (TLM)

## Background & Motivation

Our job self-assessment system began with a simple approach to LLM utilization, but as the system grew in complexity, we identified several challenges:

1. **Inconsistent Task Handling**: Different LLM tasks were implemented with varying approaches to prompting, execution, and validation.
2. **Model Selection Challenges**: Determining the optimal model for each task required manual testing and lacked a systematic approach.
3. **Quality Verification Issues**: Verifying output quality was inconsistent across tasks, leading to varying levels of reliability.
4. **Limited Learning Over Time**: The system had no structured way to improve based on historical performance.

The Task-centric LLM Management Framework (TLM) addresses these challenges by establishing a standardized approach to defining, executing, and evaluating LLM tasks. Instead of treating each task as a custom implementation, TLM provides a structured framework that enables systematic improvement and optimization.

## Overview

The Task-centric LLM Management Framework (TLM) provides a standardized approach to defining, executing, evaluating, and improving LLM-driven tasks. By formalizing task definitions and creating a structured learning system, TLM enables consistent improvement over time and optimal model selection for each specific task.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Task Definition Schema

Each LLM task is defined in a structured JSON format that contains:

- **Task metadata**: Unique identifier, name, description, version
- **Input specifications**: Expected format, validation rules, example inputs
- **Output specifications**: Expected format, validation rules, example outputs
- **Prompt variations**: Different prompt templates for the task with usage conditions
- **Verification methodology**: How outputs are verified (consensus, hierarchical, etc.)
- **Model selection criteria**: Priorities for quality vs. speed, context size requirements

### 2. Task Execution Logging

Every execution of an LLM task is recorded with:

- Task ID and version
- Input and output data
- Models used
- Verification results
- Performance metrics (time, tokens, cost)
- Feedback (automated or human)

### 3. Learning System

Task execution logs form the basis of a learning system that:

- Optimizes model selection for future tasks
- Identifies opportunities for prompt improvement
- Tracks performance patterns over time
- Provides data for system refinement

## Framework Structure

```
TaskDefinition {
  id: string                   // Unique task identifier
  name: string                 // Human-readable name
  description: string          // Purpose and usage
  version: string              // Semantic version
  input: {
    schema: object            // JSON schema for input validation
    examples: array           // Example valid inputs
    validations: array        // Functions/rules to validate input
  }
  output: {
    schema: object            // JSON schema for output validation
    examples: array           // Example valid outputs
    validations: array        // Functions/rules to validate output
  }
  prompts: [
    {
      id: string              // Prompt identifier
      text: string            // Actual prompt text
      template_variables: array // Variables to substitute
      usage_conditions: object // When to use this prompt variant
    }
  ]
  verification: {
    method: string            // "consensus", "hierarchical", "external", etc.
    parameters: {
      similarity_threshold: number
      consensus_count: number
      // Other method-specific parameters
    }
    fallback_strategy: string // What to do if verification fails
  }
  model_ranking_criteria: {
    quality_priority: number
    speed_priority: number
    context_size: string
  }
}

TaskExecution {
  task_id: string
  task_version: string
  input: object
  output: object
  models_used: array
  verification_results: {
    method_used: string
    passed: boolean
    confidence: number
    details: object
  }
  performance: {
    execution_time: number
    tokens_used: number
    cost: number
  }
  timestamp: string
  feedback: object  // Optional human or system feedback
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Task Definition Boundaries

**Challenge**: Determining the appropriate granularity for tasks.

**Considerations**:
- Tasks should represent a single logical operation with clear inputs and outputs
- Complex processes can be broken into sequential tasks
- Balance between task granularity and system complexity

**Example**: "Job detail extraction" might be a single task, or could be decomposed into "extract job title," "extract responsibilities," etc., depending on how these components are used in the system.

### Versioning Strategy

**Challenge**: Managing changes to tasks, prompts, and verification methods over time.

**Considerations**:
- Semantic versioning for task definitions
- Execution logs must reference the specific versions used
- Strategy for backwards compatibility
- Migration path for existing data when tasks change

### Cold Start Problem

**Challenge**: Selecting models and parameters for new tasks without historical data.

**Considerations**:
- Default model selection based on similar task types
- Conservative validation parameters for new tasks
- Rapid initial feedback loop for new tasks
- Bootstrapping with synthetic data or manual validation

### Processing Method Flexibility

**Challenge**: Different tasks require different verification approaches.

**Considerations**:
- Extensible verification framework supporting multiple methods:
  - Consensus checking (multiple models)
  - Hierarchical validation (LLM reviews output of another LLM)
  - External API verification (using 3rd party services)
  - Human-in-the-loop verification for critical tasks
- Parameters specific to each verification method

### Similarity Metrics

**Challenge**: Determining what makes outputs similar enough to be considered equivalent.

**Considerations**:
- Text-based similarity (difflib, cosine similarity)
- Structured data similarity (schema validation, field-by-field comparison)
- Semantic similarity (embedding-based comparison)
- Task-specific similarity functions

### Feedback Loop Integration

**Challenge**: Using execution logs to improve the system.

**Considerations**:
- Automated analysis of task performance patterns
- Regular retraining of model selection algorithms
- Prompt improvement suggestions based on failure patterns
- Human review workflow for critical changes

### Task Interdependencies

**Challenge**: Managing tasks that depend on the output of other tasks.

**Considerations**:
- Explicit dependency declarations in task definitions
- Error propagation policies
- Validation across task boundaries
- Workflow definitions for complex multi-task processes

### Resource Optimization

**Challenge**: Balancing verification thoroughness against computational cost.

**Considerations**:
- Risk-based approach to verification (more validation for critical tasks)
- Adaptive verification based on historical performance
- Batching similar tasks for efficiency
- Caching strategies for similar inputs

## Practical Implementation Guide

This section outlines the technical steps needed to implement the TLM framework within our job self-assessment system.

### 1. Directory Structure

The TLM framework will utilize the following directory structure:

```
config/
  task_definitions/     # JSON files defining each task
  validations/          # Validation functions for inputs/outputs
  model_rankings.json   # Model rankings used by the framework

scripts/
  tlm/                  # Core TLM implementation
    task_executor.py    # Task execution engine
    verification/       # Verification methods
      consensus.py
      hierarchical.py
      external.py
    validation.py       # Input/output validation
    models.py           # Model selection logic
    template_engine.py  # Prompt templating system
    logging.py          # Execution logging

data/
  task_executions/      # Logs of task executions
  model_feedback/       # Model performance data
```

### 2. Core Implementation Components

#### Task Executor

The central task execution engine will:

1. Load task definitions from JSON files
2. Validate inputs using task-specific validation rules
3. Select optimal models based on task requirements
4. Apply prompt templates with variable substitution
5. Execute the task with the selected model(s)
6. Verify outputs using the specified verification method
7. Log execution details for future analysis
8. Return verified outputs or appropriate fallback

Basic implementation structure:

```python
class TaskExecutor:
    def __init__(self, task_id, version=None):
        # Load task definition from file
        self.task_def = self._load_task_definition(task_id, version)
        self.verifiers = self._init_verifiers()
        self.validators = self._init_validators()
    
    def execute(self, input_data, execution_options=None):
        # Validate input
        self._validate_input(input_data)
        
        # Select models
        models = self._select_models(execution_options)
        
        # Apply prompt template
        prompt = self._create_prompt(input_data, execution_options)
        
        # Execute task with primary model
        primary_output = self._run_model(models[0], prompt)
        
        # Verify output
        verification_result = self._verify_output(
            input_data, primary_output, models, execution_options
        )
        
        # Log execution
        self._log_execution(
            input_data, primary_output, models, 
            verification_result, execution_options
        )
        
        # Return verified output or fallback
        if verification_result['passed']:
            return primary_output
        else:
            return self._apply_fallback_strategy(
                verification_result, models, input_data, execution_options
            )
```

#### Verification Methods

The framework will implement multiple verification methods:

1. **Consensus Verification**:
   - Executes the same task with multiple models
   - Compares outputs using similarity metrics
   - Returns the result with the highest consensus

2. **Hierarchical Verification**:
   - Uses a secondary model to review the output of the primary model
   - Follows a prompt template designed for verification
   - Returns confidence scores and suggestions

3. **External API Verification**:
   - Validates outputs against external sources
   - Can use APIs for fact-checking, syntax validation, etc.
   - Returns validation results and confidence scores

### 3. Task Definition Format

Tasks will be defined in JSON files following a standard schema. The framework will provide a validation tool to ensure all task definitions comply with the schema before being added to the system.

Key fields in the task definition:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://sunset-project.org/schemas/task-definition-v1.json",
  "id": "unique_task_id",
  "name": "Human-readable task name",
  "description": "Detailed description of the task purpose",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "input": { /* input specification */ },
  "output": { /* output specification */ },
  "prompts": [ /* prompt templates */ ],
  "verification": { /* verification configuration */ },
  "model_ranking_criteria": { /* model selection criteria */ }
}
```

### 4. Integration with Existing Components

The TLM framework will be integrated with our existing components:

1. **LLM Task Optimizer**:
   - Updated to use the task definition's model ranking criteria
   - Will load model rankings from the new structured format

2. **Model Feedback System**:
   - Enhanced to write standardized execution logs
   - Will reference task IDs and versions in all feedback

3. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Refactored as pluggable verification methods
   - Will implement task-specific verification logic

4. **Consensus Job Extractor**:
   - Refactored as a standard task with consensus verification
   - Will use the task executor for all operations

### 5. Migration Path

To migrate from our current implementation to the TLM framework:

1. Define task definitions for all existing LLM operations
2. Create initial model rankings based on current performance data
3. Implement the core TaskExecutor and verification methods
4. Refactor one task at a time to use the new framework
5. Validate performance against the previous implementation
6. Update documentation and APIs to reflect the new approach

### 6. CLI Tools

We'll develop command-line tools to facilitate working with the framework:

```bash
# Create a new task definition
tlm create-task my_task

# Validate a task definition against the schema
tlm validate-task my_task

# Execute a task from the command line
tlm execute my_task --input '{"key": "value"}'

# Analyze task execution logs
tlm analyze my_task --period 7d

# Update model rankings based on performance data
tlm update-rankings
```

## Conclusion and Future Directions

The Task-centric LLM Management Framework represents a significant evolution in our approach to LLM integration. By standardizing the definition, execution, and evaluation of LLM tasks, we create a foundation for continuous improvement and optimization.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Standardization Enables Scale**: A consistent approach to tasks allows us to scale our LLM implementation across many use cases while maintaining quality.
  
2. **Verification is Critical**: Multiple verification methods ensure appropriate quality control for different task types.

3. **Learning System**: Structured logging creates a data-driven approach to improvement over time.

4. **Task-Specific Optimization**: Different tasks have different requirements, and the framework allows for task-specific model selection and verification.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Prompt Engineering**: Analyze task execution logs to suggest prompt improvements automatically.

2. **Verification Chain**: Implement multi-step verification for critical tasks, combining multiple verification methods.

3. **Model-Task Matching Algorithm**: Develop a more sophisticated algorithm for matching tasks to models based on historical performance.

4. **Web UI for Task Management**: Create a web interface for defining, testing, and analyzing tasks.

5. **Integration with Model Training Pipelines**: Use task performance data to guide the fine-tuning of models for specific tasks.

This framework lays the groundwork for a systematic, scalable approach to LLM integration that will evolve with our needs and the rapidly developing LLM landscape.
