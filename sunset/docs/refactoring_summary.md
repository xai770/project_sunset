# Refactoring Summary: Removal of SDR Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Simplified Skill Matching Orchestrator**
   - Removed all SDR-related code from `skill_matching_orchestrator.py`
   - Focused exclusively on the faster bucketed matching approach
   - Simplified the return values and logic flow

2. **CLI Arguments Updates**
   - Removed all SDR-specific command line arguments from `cli_args.py`
   - Removed the `--bucketed` and `--enhanced` flags since bucketed matching is now the default
   - Kept essential parameters like `--batch-size`, `--max-workers`, etc.

3. **Auto-Fix Module Updates**
   - Refactored `auto_fix.py` to use only the bucketed matching approach
   - Removed dependencies on SDR implementation
   - Simplified code paths and error handling

4. **Utility Functions Updates**
   - Renamed `check_for_missing_sdr_skills()` to `check_for_missing_skills()`
   - Updated function to check for bucketed skills instead of SDR skills
   - Updated imports across all modules

5. **Pipeline Orchestrator Updates**
   - Updated log messages to remove references to SDR
   - Updated function calls to match new function names
   - Simplified the skill processing logic

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**
   - The pipeline now exclusively uses the faster bucketed matching approach
   - Removes the slow skill enrichment process that was part of the SDR implementation
   - Maintains the quality of skill matching while improving speed

2. **Simplified Codebase**
   - Reduced complexity by removing alternative approaches
   - Clearer code paths with fewer conditionals
   - Better maintainability and easier to understand

3. **Consistent Interface**
   - Command line interface now focuses on a single approach
   - No more confusing options between different matching methods
   - Better user experience with fewer decisions to make

## Testing

- Created test script to verify the refactored code
- Ensured all references to SDR have been removed
- The pipeline now operates exclusively with the bucketed matching approach

## Next Steps

1. Update documentation to reflect the new streamlined approach
2. Run comprehensive performance tests to verify improved speed
3. Consider further optimizations to the bucketed matching implementation
