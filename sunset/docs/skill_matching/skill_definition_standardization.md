# Skill Definition Standardization Framework

## Core Principles

1. **Consistency**: Use standardized keywords and phrases across all skill definitions
2. **Hierarchy**: Implement clear skill levels (Base, Intermediate, Advanced)
3. **Specificity**: Prefer specific skill definitions over generic terms
4. **Component-Based**: Classify skills by knowledge, context, and function

## Standardized Structure

### Terminology Standards
- Maintain consistent verb forms (e.g., "Developing" not "Development")
- Use established naming patterns (e.g., "[Technology] Development")
- Define clear boundaries between related skills

### Hierarchical Classification
- **Level 1 (Base)**: Foundational knowledge and basic application
  - Example: "SQL Basics" - Simple queries, understanding tables
- **Level 2 (Intermediate)**: Practical application in standard situations
  - Example: "SQL Development" - Complex queries, joins, procedures
- **Level 3 (Advanced)**: Expert application, optimization, innovation
  - Example: "SQL Performance Optimization" - Query tuning, indexing

### Specificity Requirements
- Replace generic terms with specific skills:
  - "Programming" → "Java Development", "Python Scripting"
  - "Communication" → "Technical Documentation", "Executive Presentation"
  - "Analysis" → "Business Process Analysis", "Requirements Analysis"
- Add qualifiers when needed (e.g., "Cloud Architecture, AWS")

## Component Classification

### Knowledge Components
- Definition: Theoretical understanding or factual information
- Examples: "Understanding of database normalization", "Knowledge of ITIL"

### Context Components
- Definition: Environments or situations where skills are applied
- Examples: "Enterprise software development", "Financial services environment"

### Function Components
- Definition: Practical application of knowledge
- Examples: "Developing software applications", "Analyzing business requirements"

  "level": 2,
  "knowledge_components": ["workflow_analysis", "scripting"],
  "contexts": ["office", "business_process"],
  "functions": ["efficiency_improvement", "task_simplification"]
