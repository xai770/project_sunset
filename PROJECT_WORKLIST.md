## üö® KNOWN ISSUES TO TRACK

### üêõ Active Bugs
1. ~~**Location Validation Data Format**~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
   - ~~Specialist expects: `"Frankfurt, Germany"`~~
   - ~~Job data provides: `{"city": "Frankfurt", "country": "Germany"}`~~
   - ~~Impact: Location validation fails~~
   - ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Added format conversion in direct_specialist_manager.py

2. **Processing State Integration**
   - `processing_state_manager.py` exists but not integrated
   - Main pipeline doesn't use version tracking yet
   - Priority: MEDIUM

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues
- Ollama service availability/reliability
- Specialist response time variability
- Job data format changes over time
- Specialist version compatibility

## üí° NOTES & REMINDERS

- Always test specialist changes with real job data first
- Keep job data and processing state separate (don't pollute JSONs)
- Version tracking is critical for reproducibility
- LLM processing times vary - build in appropriate timeouts
- Document any specialist API changes for future reference
