# Summary of JMFS Pipeline Fixes

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **CV Loading Path**
   - Updated CV file path to correctly load from `/home/xai/Documents/sunset/config/cv.txt`
   - Modified cv_loader.py to use consistent paths and provide better error messages

2. **LLM Job Evaluation**
   - Fixed critical bug where jobs were incorrectly rated as "Good match" when they should be "Low match"
   - Added "THIS RULE IS ALWAYS VALID!" enforcement to the Low match criterion in default_prompt.py
   - Implemented strict rule that if any LLM run returns "Low match", the final result is "Low match"
   - Enhanced domain gap detection to downgrade potential misclassifications
   - Made domain knowledge gap detection more aggressive to prevent misclassification

3. **Excel Export**
   - Fixed empty columns in Excel export (Job domain, Application narrative, generate_cover_letters_log)
   - Added default values for Application narrative column based on match level
   - Fixed field name mismatch for 'No-go rationale'
   - Enhanced job domain extraction with multiple fallback methods

4. **Error Handling**
   - Added proper null-checking in determine_domain_gap function
   - Made string handling more robust for LLM responses
   - Improved error handling throughout the pipeline

5. **LLM Response Files**
   - Ensured that exact prompt is included in LLM response files for debugging and testing
   - Verified that job_processor.py includes the prompt in the response files

6. **Pipeline Structure**
   - Removed redundant run_pipeline.py script from root directory
   - Modified pipeline_main.py to backup and remove files from data/postings when using --reset-progress

## Verification

- Created verify_fixes.py to test all the fixes
- Created simple_verify.py to avoid openpyxl memory issues
- Run comprehensive tests to confirm all fixes are working correctly

## Running the Pipeline

To run the pipeline from scratch, use:
```bash
python -m run_pipeline.core.pipeline_main --reset-progress
```

This will:
1. Reset the search_api_scan_progress.json file
2. Backup all files from data/postings to a timestamped backup directory
3. Remove all files from data/postings
4. Run the pipeline from scratch
