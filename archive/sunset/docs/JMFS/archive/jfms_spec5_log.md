# JMFS Steps 7-10 Implementation Log

## 2025-05-26

- [x] Reviewed and confirmed requirements in docs/JMFS/jfms_spec5.md
- [x] Added CLI arguments: --enable-feedback-loop, --reviewer-name, --reviewer-email to run_pipeline/core/cli_args.py
- [x] Implemented robust step functions for Steps 7-10 in run_pipeline/core/pipeline_orchestrator.py:
    - run_excel_export_step
    - run_cover_letter_generation_step
    - run_email_delivery_step
    - run_feedback_processing_step
- [x] Replaced old JMFS section with new function calls and error handling
- [x] Defensive coding and logging added for all steps
- [x] Pipeline now supports --enable-feedback-loop for full JMFS workflow

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test pipeline with and without --enable-feedback-loop
- [ ] Verify graceful degradation if any JMFS component is missing
- [ ] Check logs for correct step execution and error handling
