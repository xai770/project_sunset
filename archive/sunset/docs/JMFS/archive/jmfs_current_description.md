# JMFS - Job Matching Feedback System
## Current System Description (2025-05-26)

---

## 🎯 **System Overview**

The **Job Matching Feedback System (JMFS)** is an intelligent, human-centered job search automation platform that combines AI-powered job matching with human feedback loops to continuously improve matching accuracy while gracefully handling the beautiful chaos of human behavior ("wetbrains").

---

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Core Philosophy**
- **LLM-First Design**: Use AI for complex decisions instead of hard-coded rules
- **Wetbrain-Proof**: Humans are messy, moody, unpredictable - embrace and handle it gracefully
- **Excel-Centric Workflow**: Familiar interface for human reviewers with complete audit trails
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even when components fail

### **Two-Phase Architecture**

#### **Phase 1: Job Processing Pipeline (Steps 1-6)**
**Foundation job discovery, cleaning, and matching**
- Job metadata fetching and validation
- Job description cleaning and standardization  
- Skills extraction and analysis
- **Llama3.2-powered CV-to-job matching** with sophisticated domain analysis
- Match level determination: Low/Moderate/Good
- Application narrative or no-go rationale generation

#### **Phase 2: JMFS Feedback Loop (Steps 7-10)**
**Human-AI collaborative improvement system**
- Excel export with standardized A-R column structure
- Cover letter generation for qualified matches
- Email delivery to human reviewers
- Intelligent feedback processing with specialized LLM workers

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow**

### **Step 1-6: Job Processing**
```
Job Discovery → Cleaning → Skills Analysis → CV Matching → Assessment Generation
```

### **Step 7: Excel Export**
- Export jobs with standardized A-R column structure
- Initialize logging columns with timestamps
- Apply proper formatting for human review

### **Step 8: Cover Letter Generation**
- Generate cover letters ONLY for "Good" matches with application narratives
- Use existing cover letter template system
- Log generation activity in column M
- Save as `cover_letter_[jobID].md` files

### **Step 9: Email Delivery**
- Send Excel + cover letter attachments to reviewer
- Subject format: `{reviewer_name} job_matches_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`
- Use existing Gmail OAuth2 infrastructure
- Track delivery status

### **Step 10: Feedback Processing**
**Intelligent feedback routing with specialized LLM workers:**

#### **Master Feedback Dispatcher**
- Analyzes returned Excel files for reviewer feedback
- Routes feedback to appropriate specialized workers
- Coordinates response actions

#### **Specialized LLM Workers**
1. **Cover Letter Generator** - Handles false negatives
2. **Conflict Resolver** - Addresses contradictory assessments  
3. **Gibberish Clarifier** - Processes unclear feedback
4. **Learning Processor** - Updates system based on valid feedback

#### **Mailman Service**
- Monitors Gmail for returned Excel files
- Extracts attachments and triggers processing
- Maintains processed email log

## 🧠 **AI Components**

### **Primary Matching LLM (Llama3.2)**
```
Input: CV + Job Description
Processing: Domain-specific analysis with strict output format
Output: Match level + Domain assessment + Narrative/Rationale
```

### **Feedback Dispatcher LLM (Llama3.2)**
```
Input: Excel data with reviewer feedback
Processing: Route to appropriate action type
Output: Structured action plan for specialized workers
```

### **Specialized Worker LLMs (Llama3.2)**
- **Cover Letter Generator**: Creates professional cover letters for false negatives
- **Conflict Resolver**: Generates evidence-based clarification emails
- **Gibberish Clarifier**: Writes friendly requests for clarification
- **Learning Processor**: Analyzes patterns and updates system prompts

## 💭 **Wetbrain Scenarios & Responses**

### **Scenario Matrix**
| Human Behavior | System Response | LLM Worker |
|---|---|---|
| 😴 No feedback | Continue normally | None |
| ✅ Good feedback | Process for learning | Learning Processor |
| 🔄 Contradictory | Send clarification email | Conflict Resolver |
| 🤪 Gibberish | Request clarification politely | Gibberish Clarifier |
| 📧 False negative | Generate missing cover letter | Cover Letter Generator |

### **Communication Personalities**
- **Professional**: Evidence-based conflict resolution
- **Friendly**: Non-judgmental gibberish clarification
- **Encouraging**: Positive reinforcement for good feedback
- **Patient**: Multiple contact attempts before giving up

---

## 🔧 **Technical Infrastructure**

### **Core Technologies**
- **LLM Platform**: Ollama (local deployment for stability)
- **Primary Model**: Llama3.2 (frozen versions for consistency)
- **Data Format**: Excel (XLSX) with pandas processing
- **Email**: Gmail API with OAuth2 authentication
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails in Excel + file logs

### **Integration Points**
- **Pipeline Integration**: Steps 7-10 in existing job processing pipeline
- **Email Infrastructure**: Reuses existing `email_sender.py` OAuth2 setup
- **Cover Letter System**: Integrates with existing template management
- **Prompt Management**: Version-controlled prompts with feedback-driven updates

## 🎪 **The Vision**

JMFS represents a new paradigm in human-AI collaboration for job searching. Rather than replacing human judgment, it amplifies human intelligence while handling the tedious work of job discovery, initial screening, and administrative tasks.

The system recognizes that job searching is deeply personal and emotional, requiring empathy and understanding that pure automation cannot provide. By combining AI efficiency with human insight, JMFS creates a more humane and effective job search experience.

**Ultimate goal**: Help people find meaningful work while reducing the stress, uncertainty, and administrative burden of job searching - especially for those who struggle with traditional job search processes.

*"Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around. JMFS puts humans at the center of AI-powered job matching."*
