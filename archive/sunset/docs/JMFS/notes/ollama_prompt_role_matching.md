# Instructions
I am considering to apply for a new role. Read my CV and compare it to the role description.

Given the role and my CV, provide:

- A conservative match percentage (0-100%) indicating how well I might fit the job (as a single line: Match Percentage: <number>%). 

Rate based on this scale:
0-20%: Fundamental mismatch
21-40%: Major upskilling needed  
41-60%: Missing explicit experience in one or more key requirements - NOT a good fit
61-80%: Strong match, has all key requirements with only minor gaps in secondary areas
81-100%: Excellent fit, exceeds most requirements

Note: If I lack explicit experience in any KEY requirement (e.g., specific technology, industry, or critical skill explicitly required), the score cannot exceed 60%.

- If score is 61% or higher: Write a concise, professional cover letter for me. Do NOT oversell me! Be open about skill gaps. Do NOT mention the match percentage in the cover letter itself.

- If score is 60% or lower: Write a personal log entry, why I have decided to not apply for this role.
