## Phase 1: Current System Testing & Validation (Week 1) 🧪

### **1.1 Generate Test Cover Letters**
**Owner:** Copilot (Implementation) + Claude (Quality Review)  
**Timeline:** Day 1-2  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Test Strategy:**
Since we have no "Good" matches in current data, we need to artificially create test scenarios to validate the cover letter generation system.

**Test Cases:**
1. **Force a "Good" match** on an existing job to test the system
2. **Create mock job data** with "Good" rating for comprehensive testing
3. **Test edge cases** (missing data, malformed job descriptions)
4. **Validate integration** with Excel export and email systems

**Implementation Requirements:**
```python
# Create test override functionality
def force_test_cover_letter_generation():
    # Take existing job, override match level to "Good"
    # Generate cover letter using current system
    # Document any issues or failures
    # Test full pipeline integration
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Cover letter generation system works end-to-end
