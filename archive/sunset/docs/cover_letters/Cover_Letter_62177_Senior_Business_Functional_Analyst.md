## Application for Senior Business Functional Analyst - Reference: R0385120

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Business Functional Analyst position  advertised on your careers website: https://careers.db.com/professionals/search-roles/#/professional/job/62177

Having been with Deutsche Bank since 1999, I have witnessed and contributed to the evolution of our organization over the past 26 years. This long-term engagement has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of our banking culture, processes, and strategic direction, which I would bring to this role. My professional experience in Team Leadership aligns well with this position, where I can effectively apply my capabilities in Team Leadership and Cloud Development to benefit the bank.

My qualifications align with your requirements in several key areas. I have particular expertise in Team Leadership.

In my current position as Project Lead in Contract Compliance/Tech Lead at Deutsche Bank, I have gained substantial experience in conceptualizing and implementing bank-wide solutions. These experiences correspond in many aspects to the requirements of the advertised position:

- **Team Leadership**: My extensive experience in Team Leadership includes team management, technical mentoring, architectural guidance and other relevant skills.

While I have not directly worked in Cloud Development, DevOps, Backend Development or Agile Methodologies, I am confident that my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and adapt to evolving environments would enable me to develop proficiency in these areas.

I am particularly drawn to this position because of the opportunity to work on innovative technical solutions. Through my extensive experience in various areas of Deutsche Bank, I understand both the technical and business aspects of the challenges we face. My background in developing and implementing technical solutions, combined with my understanding of technical requirements and architecture principles, would enable me to develop robust and scalable solutions.

I possess strong analytical skills and maintain a structured working approach. I am solution-oriented and can work effectively both independently and within teams. My communication skills in German and English, coupled with my ability to explain complex technical concepts clearly, would help me to communicate complex technical concepts clearly to stakeholders.

I am motivated by the opportunity to continue contributing to Deutsche Bank's success story in this new position. I would welcome the chance to discuss my qualifications in a personal interview and am flexible regarding scheduling.

Yours sincerely,

Gershon Urs Pollatschek
