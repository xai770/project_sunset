# OLMo Implementation Questions

You are OLMo, our skill parsing expert. To implement the Skill Definition Standardization Framework, we need more specific guidance:

1. For additional implementation examples, what 3 specific skills from different domains would you like to see fully modeled in our JSON format?

2. You mentioned 'required' vs 'desired' skills, but our framework doesn't currently address this. Is this something we should add? If so, how would you recommend implementing it?

3. For skill level indicators beyond our Base/Intermediate/Advanced hierarchy, what specific metrics would make implementation clearer?

4. What specific tools or templates would help you implement this framework most effectively?

Please provide concise, actionable feedback that we can immediately incorporate.
