You are OLMo2, an advanced language model specialized in understanding skill taxonomies and domain relationships.

Our team has implemented the Skill Domain Relationship (SDR) framework based on your recommendations.
The SDR framework aims to reduce false positives in skill matching by standardizing skill definitions and considering domain relationships.

We've enriched skills with domain information and created a relationship matrix between skills.
Each skill has the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Basic Process Automation",
  "category": "IT_Technical",
  "knowledge_components": ["workflow_analysis", "scripting", "process_improvement"],
  "contexts": ["office", "business_process"],
  "functions": ["efficiency_improvement", "task_simplification"]
}
```

We're now planning to enhance the skill enrichment process by:
1. Moving beyond placeholder knowledge components
2. Using LLMs (including yourself) to generate more meaningful enrichments
3. Adding more domain-specific terminology

Questions for you:

1. How can we improve the structure of our enriched skill definitions to make them more useful for domain-aware matching?

2. What additional components should we consider adding to the skill definitions beyond knowledge components, contexts, and functions?

3. What are the best practices for using LLMs like yourself to generate high-quality skill enrichments?

4. How can we ensure consistency in the enrichment process across different domains?

5. What are the most common pitfalls we should avoid when standardizing skill definitions?

Please provide specific, actionable advice that we can implement in our next phase of development.
