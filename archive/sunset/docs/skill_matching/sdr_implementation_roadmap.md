# SDR Implementation Roadmap

*Date: May 20, 2025*
*Updated with OLMo2 Insights*

This document outlines the phased implementation approach for the Skill Domain Relationship (SDR) framework, providing a clear path from the simplest functioning implementation to a more comprehensive solution.

## OLMo2 Implementation Insights

Based on OLMo2's exceptional performance in skill parsing and categorization tasks, the following insights have been incorporated into our implementation strategy:

### Skill Definition Standardization
- **Consistency Guidelines**: Implement standardized keywords/phrases for each skill category
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Define clear skill hierarchies (Base, Intermediate, Advanced)
- **Specificity**: Prioritize specific skill definitions over generic terms
- **Component Classification**:
  - **Knowledge**: Skills based on theoretical understanding or factual information
  - **Context**: Skills requiring adaptation to specific situations
  - **Function**: Skills involving practical application of knowledge

### Domain Relationship Classification
- **Jaccard Similarity Thresholds**: Initial recommendation of 0.5-0.7 for relationship typing
- **Cross-Domain Skills**: Implement hierarchical classification with hybrid categories for skills spanning multiple domains
- **Weighted Domain Scores**: Assign weights based on domain prevalence in specific roles

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Potential Failure Points**: Data quality issues, subjective skill interpretations, rapid changes in job requirements
- **Contingency Plan**: Implement continuous learning models, human expert validation, and user feedback loops

### Implementation Priority
- **Skill Priority**: Begin with base skills, followed by functional skills, then advanced domain-specific skills
- **Component Sequence**: Start with data collection → domain categorization → skill parsing → iterative improvement

## Guiding Principles

1. **Start simple** - Begin with core functionality to solve the immediate false positive matching issues
2. **Test early** - Validate each component with real-world examples before proceeding
3. **Incremental value** - Ensure each phase delivers tangible improvements
4. **Realistic timelines** - Focus on achievable milestones with consistent progress

## Phase 1: Core SDR Implementation (June 10, 2025)

### Goals
- Implement basic domain enrichment for skills
- Replace semantic matching with simple domain-aware matching
- Solve the immediate false positive issues with generic skills
- Establish standardized skill definition framework based on OLMo's recommendations

### Skill Selection Methodology

To identify the top 50 skills for initial enrichment, we will use a data-driven approach:

1. **Frequency Analysis**
   - Analyze all job descriptions in our database
   - Calculate Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores for all skill terms
   - Identify skills that appear most frequently across job postings

2. **False Positive Analysis**
   - Analyze historical matching data to identify skills that produce the most false positives
   - Prioritize ambiguous skills like "automation," "analysis," "development" that cross multiple domains

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Calculate the "impact score" for each skill using:
     ```
     Impact Score = Frequency × Ambiguity Factor × Usage in Essential Requirements
     ```
   - Prioritize skills with the highest impact scores

4. **Domain Distribution**
   - Ensure representation of skills across all six core domains
   - Select at least 5 skills from each domain category
   
5. **Skill Hierarchy Classification**
   - Classify each selected skill as Base, Intermediate, or Advanced level
   - Ensure coverage across all hierarchy levels for comprehensive matching

This methodology ensures we focus our initial effort on skills that will have the greatest impact on matching quality improvement.

### Tasks

1. **Skill Domain Enrichment**
   - Enrich the top 50 most-used skills with:
     - Knowledge components
     - Contexts
     - Functions
   - Focus on problematic generic skills first (e.g., "automation", "analysis")
   - Use the model described in the implementation doc:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Basic Process Automation",
     "category": "IT_Technical",
     "knowledge_components": ["workflow_analysis", "scripting", "process_improvement"],
     "contexts": ["office", "business_process"],
     "functions": ["efficiency_improvement", "task_simplification"]
   }
   ```

2. **Basic Domain Relationship Classification**
   - Implement the core relationship types:
     - Exact match
     - Subset
     - Superset
     - Neighboring
     - Unrelated
     - Hybrid (for skills spanning multiple domains)
   - Use Jaccard similarity with thresholds of 0.5-0.7 as recommended by OLMo2
   - Implement weighted domain scores for skills with multiple domain applicability

3. **Simple Matching Algorithm Update**
   - Replace semantic matching with domain overlap calculation
   - Implement filtering based on relationship types
   - Create baseline tests with known problematic skills

### Deliverables

## Success Metrics

We will evaluate the success of each implementation phase using these metrics:

4. **System Performance**
   - Measure response times for matching and analysis
   - Target: < 5 seconds for a full match analysis

## Conclusion

This phased approach allows us to quickly implement the core SDR functionality and solve the immediate false positive issues while providing a clear path to a more comprehensive solution. By starting with the simplest effective implementation, we can validate our approach early and iterate based on real-world feedback.
