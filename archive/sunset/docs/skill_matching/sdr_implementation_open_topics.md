# SDR Implementation: Open Topics & Pre-Development Considerations

*Date: May 19, 2025*

This document outlines key topics that should be discussed and clarified before beginning implementation of the Skill Domain Relationship (SDR) framework. Addressing these points will help ensure smooth implementation and reduce potential roadblocks.

## 1. Skill Definition Standardization

- **Consistent Format**: What guidelines will we follow to ensure skill definitions have consistent granularity and structure?
- **Component Guidelines**: How do we distinguish between knowledge components, contexts, and functions?
- **Quality Control**: What review process will validate domain enrichments for accuracy and consistency?
- **Naming Conventions**: How will we handle variations of the same skill (e.g., "Python Programming" vs. "Python Development")?

## 2. Evaluation and Testing

- **Benchmark Dataset**: Do we have a collection of known problematic matches to test against?
- **False Positive Measurement**: How exactly will we measure the "80% reduction in false positives"?
- **Test Coverage**: What specific test cases should we create to validate the effectiveness of domain-aware matching?
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Who will validate that the new matching produces better results?

## 3. LLM Integration Logistics

- **API Access**: Do we have the necessary access to phi4-mini-reasoning, llama3.2, and mistral?
- **Rate Limits**: How will we handle API rate limits during batch processing?
- **Cost Management**: What is our budget for LLM API calls, and how will we optimize usage?
- **Local vs. Cloud**: Will we use self-hosted models or cloud API services?
- **Prompt Engineering**: Who will be responsible for fine-tuning and optimizing prompts?

## 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Fallback Plans**: What alternatives do we have if the domain-aware approach doesn't perform as expected?
- **Performance Issues**: How will we handle if the system becomes significantly slower?
- **Quality Control**: What checks will ensure LLM-generated domain components are accurate?
- **Partial Deployment**: Could we implement the system for a subset of skills/jobs first?
- **Rollback Strategy**: How can we quickly revert to the previous system if needed?

## 5. Dependencies and Timeline

- **Critical Dependencies**: Which components must be completed before others can begin?
- **Resource Availability**: Do we have all team members needed for the entire timeline?
- **External Dependencies**: Are we reliant on any third-party services or updates?
- **Timeline Flexibility**: Which implementation dates are hard deadlines vs. flexible targets?
- **Milestone Reviews**: When should we schedule implementation reviews and go/no-go decisions?

## 6. Data Privacy and Security

- **Sensitive Data Handling**: How will we ensure job descriptions and candidate data are handled securely?
- **LLM Data Protection**: What measures will prevent sensitive information from being sent to external LLMs?
- **Anonymization Process**: Should we implement a data anonymization step before LLM processing?
- **Compliance Requirements**: Does our approach meet all relevant data protection regulations?
- **Audit Trail**: How will we track data usage for compliance and security purposes?

## 7. Team Structure and Responsibilities

- **Component Ownership**: Who will be responsible for implementing each major component?
- **Review Process**: What code review procedures will we follow?
- **Subject Matter Experts**: Who will provide domain expertise for validating skill classifications?
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: When and how will stakeholders be involved in the implementation process?
- **Knowledge Transfer**: How will we ensure knowledge sharing across the team?

## 8. Technical Implementation Details

- **Jaccard Similarity Thresholds**: What thresholds define each relationship type?
- **Performance Optimization**: How will we optimize matching for large numbers of skills/jobs?
- **Storage and Caching**: How will we store domain-enriched skills and cache relationship calculations?
- **Integration Points**: What are the specific touch points with existing systems?
- **API Design**: What APIs will other systems use to access the domain-aware matching?

## 9. User Experience Considerations

- **Explanation of Changes**: How will we communicate the new matching approach to users?
- **UI Adaptations**: What UI changes are needed to reflect domain-aware matching results?
- **Feedback Collection**: How will we gather user feedback on the new system?
- **Transition Period**: Should we temporarily show both old and new match results for comparison?

## 10. Success Criteria and Measurement

- **Key Performance Indicators**: Beyond the metrics mentioned, what would make this implementation a clear success?
- **Quantitative Metrics**: How will we measure the system's performance improvement?
- **Qualitative Feedback**: How will we collect and incorporate user satisfaction data?
- **Long-term Evaluation**: What ongoing monitoring will ensure sustained performance?

## Next Steps

1. Schedule a pre-implementation meeting to address these topics
2. Assign owners to research and prepare recommendations for each area
3. Document decisions in an implementation requirements document
4. Update the implementation roadmap with clarified details
5. Establish regular check-points to revisit open questions throughout development

## Conclusion

Resolving these open topics before beginning development will help ensure a smoother implementation process and reduce the risk of mid-project course corrections. It will also help set clear expectations among all stakeholders regarding the implementation approach and expected outcomes.
