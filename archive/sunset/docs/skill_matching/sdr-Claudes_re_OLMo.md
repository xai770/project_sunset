# SDR Framework Implementation Guide

## 1. Skill Definition Standardization

### Guidelines for Consistent Skill Definitions

1. **Standardized Terminology**
   - Maintain a central glossary of approved skill terms
   - Use consistent verb forms (e.g., "Developing" vs "Development")
   - Establish naming patterns (e.g., "[Technology] Development" or "Management, [Resource]")
   - Define clear boundaries between related skills (e.g., "Data Analysis" vs "Data Science")

2. **Hierarchical Structure**
   - **Level 1 (Base)**: Foundational knowledge and basic application
     - Example: "SQL Basics" - Writing simple queries, understanding table structure
   - **Level 2 (Intermediate)**: Practical application in standard situations
     - Example: "SQL Development" - Creating complex queries, joins, and stored procedures
   - **Level 3 (Advanced)**: Expert application, optimization, and innovation
     - Example: "SQL Performance Optimization" - Query tuning, index optimization, execution plan analysis

3. **Specificity Standards**
   - Replace generic terms with specific skills:
     - Instead of "Programming" → "Java Development," "Python Scripting," etc.
     - Instead of "Communication" → "Technical Documentation," "Executive Presentation," etc.
     - Instead of "Analysis" → "Business Process Analysis," "Requirements Analysis," etc.
   - Include qualifiers when needed for clarity (e.g., "Cloud Architecture, AWS" vs just "Cloud Architecture")

### Distinguishing Between Components

1. **Knowledge Components**
   - **Definition**: Theoretical understanding or factual information
   - **Identifiers**: Terms like "understanding of," "knowledge of," "familiarity with"
   - **Examples**:
     - Understanding of database normalization principles
     - Knowledge of ITIL framework
     - Familiarity with regulatory requirements

2. **Context Components**
   - **Definition**: Environments or situations where skills are applied
   - **Identifiers**: Settings, environments, or situations
   - **Examples**:
     - Enterprise software development
     - Financial services environment
     - Cross-functional team settings

3. **Function Components**
   - **Definition**: Practical application of knowledge
   - **Identifiers**: Action verbs, tasks, or responsibilities
   - **Examples**:
     - Developing software applications
     - Managing vendor relationships
     - Analyzing business requirements

## 2. Domain Relationship Classification

### Jaccard Similarity Thresholds

| Relationship Type | Threshold Range | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Identical | ≥ 0.85 | Nearly identical skill sets |
| Subset/Superset | 0.70 - 0.84 | One skill encompasses the other |
| Adjacent | 0.50 - 0.69 | Significant overlap in skill components |
| Neighboring | 0.30 - 0.49 | Moderate overlap, typically related domains |
| Transferable | 0.15 - 0.29 | Limited but meaningful relationship |
| Unrelated | < 0.15 | Minimal or no relationship |

### Handling Cross-Domain Skills

1. **Primary/Secondary Domain Assignment**
   - Assign a primary domain based on the skill's core functionality
   - Add secondary domain tags for significant cross-domain relevance
   - Example: "Data Visualization" might be primarily IT_Technical but also Analysis_and_Reporting

2. **Weighted Domain Relevance**
   - Assign percentage weights to indicate domain relevance distribution
   - Example: "Project Management" might be 60% Leadership_and_Management, 40% IT_Management

3. **Skill Bridging**
   - Create explicit bridge relationships between domains
   - Document which skills commonly serve as bridges between domains
   - Example: "Business Analysis" bridges Analysis_and_Reporting and Domain_Knowledge

## 3. Risk Mitigation

### Potential Failure Points

1. **Data Quality Issues**
   - **Risk**: Inconsistent job descriptions, vague skill definitions
   - **Mitigation**: Implement data cleaning pipelines, require minimum information standards

2. **Semantic Inconsistency**
   - **Risk**: Same skills described using different terminology
   - **Mitigation**: Implement synonym matching, contextual understanding, standardized skill extraction

3. **Domain Boundary Ambiguity**
   - **Risk**: Unclear classification of skills that span multiple domains
   - **Mitigation**: Clear domain definition documentation, cross-domain mapping guidelines

4. **Overfitting to Training Data**
   - **Risk**: System performs well on known patterns but fails on new job descriptions
   - **Mitigation**: Regular retraining with new data, diversity in training datasets

### Contingency Approaches

1. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Implement multiple parsing algorithms and use voting mechanisms
   - Combine LLM-based parsing with rule-based approaches
   - Use different models for different domains or job types

2. **Human-in-the-Loop**
   - Set confidence thresholds below which human review is triggered
   - Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement
   - Create interfaces for easy correction of misclassifications

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Design the system to fall back to broader categorizations when specific ones fail
   - Maintain hierarchical skill definitions to enable approximate matching
   - Include confidence scores with all classifications

## 4. Implementation Sequence

### Priority Skills for Initial Implementation

1. **High-Frequency Core Skills**
   - Common technical skills (e.g., programming languages, database technologies)
   - Universal management skills (e.g., project management, team leadership)
   - Cross-domain analytical skills (e.g., data analysis, requirements gathering)

2. **Well-Defined Skills**
   - Skills with standardized certifications or qualifications
   - Skills with clear measurement criteria
   - Skills with established industry definitions

3. **High-Value Differentiators**
   - Skills that strongly predict job success
   - Skills with significant talent gaps in the market
   - Skills that are difficult to assess through traditional methods

### Logical Implementation Sequence

1. **Foundation Phase (Months 1-3)**
   - Set up skill taxonomy database
   - Implement basic skill extraction from job descriptions
   - Establish baseline domain classification

2. **Enhancement Phase (Months 4-6)**
   - Add relationship mapping between skills
   - Implement context awareness in skill classification
   - Develop initial matching algorithms

   - Implement continuous learning systems
   - Develop advanced match visualization and reporting

## 5. Measurement and Success Criteria

   - Domain classification accuracy
   - Relationship type classification accuracy

2. **Operational Metrics**
   - Processing time per document
   - System stability and error rates
