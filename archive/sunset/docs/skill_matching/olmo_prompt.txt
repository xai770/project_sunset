# Prompt for OLMo2 regarding the Skill Domain Relationship (SDR) framework

I'm working on the Skill Domain Relationship (SDR) framework which aims to reduce false positives in skill matching by standardizing skill definitions and considering domain relationships between skills. 

So far, we have implemented:
1. A Skill Analyzer that extracts and enriches skills with domain information
2. A Domain Relationship Classifier that builds a relationship matrix using Jaccard similarity
3. A Domain-Aware Matcher that uses these relationships to improve matching quality

Each skill is enriched with this structure:
```json
{
  "name": "Basic Process Automation",
  "category": "IT_Technical",
  "knowledge_components": ["workflow_analysis", "scripting", "process_improvement"],
  "contexts": ["office", "business_process"],
  "functions": ["efficiency_improvement", "task_simplification"]
}
```

We want to improve our skill enrichment process. How can we:
1. Create more meaningful knowledge components, contexts, and functions?
2. Ensure consistency across different domains?
3. What additional components might be valuable to add to skill definitions?
4. What best practices should we follow when using LLMs to generate these enrichments?
