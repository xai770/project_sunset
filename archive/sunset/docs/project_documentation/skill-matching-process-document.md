# Skill-Based CV-to-Job Matching System: Process Document

## Overview

This document outlines the end-to-end process for a skill-based CV-to-job matching system that leverages our mathematical framework for skill domain relationships. The system will parse CVs and job descriptions, convert them to a structured format, analyze skill relationships, and determine the degree of match between a candidate and a job opening.

## System Components

1. **CV Parser**: Extracts structured skill data from candidate CVs
2. **Job Description Parser**: Extracts structured skill requirements from job postings
3. **Skill Matching Algorithm**: Applies our mathematical framework to determine relationship types and compatibility scores
4. **Match Evaluation System**: Produces final recommendation and highlights gaps

## Skill Data Structure

Skills will be represented using the following JSON schema:

```json
{
  "name": "String: Name of the skill",
  "ontological_category": "String: Tool/Technological, Methodological, Cognitive, Social, Dispositional, Meta-Skill",
  "abstraction_level": "Integer: 1 (Concrete) to 5 (Abstract/Strategic)",
  "knowledge_components": ["Array of strings: Specific elements of knowledge"],
  "contexts": ["Array of strings: Environments where the skill is applied"],
  "functions": ["Array of strings: Purposes the skill serves"],
  "proficiency_level": "Integer: Required/possessed expertise level (1-10)",
  "evidence": ["Array of strings: Text evidence supporting this skill"]
}
```

## Process Flow

### 1. CV Processing

1. **Input**: Candidate CV (PDF, Markdown, or plain text)
2. **Processing**: 
   - Parse CV text into sections (experience, skills, education, etc.)
   - Extract explicit skills mentioned
   - Infer implicit skills from described activities
   - Categorize each skill according to framework dimensions
3. **Output**: Structured JSON representation of candidate's skills

### 2. Job Description Processing

1. **Input**: Job description (PDF, Markdown, or plain text)
2. **Processing**:
   - Parse job text into sections (responsibilities, requirements, etc.)
   - Extract explicit skill requirements
   - Infer implicit skill requirements from described responsibilities
   - Categorize each skill according to framework dimensions
   - Flag skills as "essential" or "desirable" based on wording
3. **Output**: Structured JSON representation of job skill requirements

### 3. Skill Matching

1. **Input**: 
   - Structured candidate skills JSON
   - Structured job requirements JSON
2. **Processing**:
   - For each job skill:
     - Identify candidate skills in same ontological category and similar abstraction level
     - Calculate compatibility metrics (knowledge overlap, context overlap, function overlap, level ratio)
     - Determine relationship type (Subset, Superset, Adjacent, etc.)
     - Assign compatibility percentage
   - Identify unmatched job skills as gaps
   - Calculate overall match percentage
3. **Output**: Match analysis JSON with compatibility scores and identified gaps

### 4. Recommendation Generation

1. **Input**: Match analysis JSON
2. **Processing**:
   - Apply decision rules to evaluate match quality
   - Highlight key strengths and gaps
   - Generate actionable recommendations
3. **Output**: Final recommendation with justification

## Mathematical Operations

### Comparability Check

```
Comparable(skill1, skill2) = (skill1.ontological_category == skill2.ontological_category) 
                           AND (|skill1.abstraction_level - skill2.abstraction_level| ≤ 1)
```

### Similarity Calculations

```
Knowledge_Overlap(skill1, skill2) = |skill1.knowledge_components ∩ skill2.knowledge_components| / 
                                    |skill1.knowledge_components ∪ skill2.knowledge_components|

Context_Overlap(skill1, skill2) = |skill1.contexts ∩ skill2.contexts| / 
                                  |skill1.contexts ∪ skill2.contexts|

Function_Overlap(skill1, skill2) = |skill1.functions ∩ skill2.functions| / 
                                   |skill1.functions ∪ skill2.functions|

Level_Ratio(skill1, skill2) = min(skill1.proficiency_level, skill2.proficiency_level) / 
                              max(skill1.proficiency_level, skill2.proficiency_level)
```

### Compatibility Score

```
Compatibility(skill1, skill2) = 
    IF Comparable(skill1, skill2) THEN 
        w1 * Knowledge_Overlap(skill1, skill2) + 
        w2 * Context_Overlap(skill1, skill2) + 
        w3 * Function_Overlap(skill1, skill2) + 
        w4 * Level_Ratio(skill1, skill2)
    ELSE 
        0
```
Where w1, w2, w3, and w4 are weights summing to 1.

### Relationship Type Determination

```
Relationship_Type(skill1, skill2) = 
    IF NOT Comparable(skill1, skill2) THEN "Not Comparable"
    ELSE IF skill1.knowledge_components ⊂ skill2.knowledge_components AND 
            skill1.contexts ⊂ skill2.contexts THEN "Subset"
    ELSE IF skill1.knowledge_components ⊃ skill2.knowledge_components AND 
            skill1.contexts ⊃ skill2.contexts THEN "Superset"
    ELSE IF Knowledge_Overlap(skill1, skill2) > 0.6 THEN "Adjacent"
    ELSE IF Context_Overlap(skill1, skill2) > 0.6 THEN "Neighboring"
    ELSE IF |skill1.proficiency_level - skill2.proficiency_level| > 3 THEN "Skill Level Disparity"
    ELSE IF Function_Overlap(skill1, skill2) > 0.7 THEN "Analogous"
    ELSE IF Knowledge_Overlap(skill1, skill2) > 0.3 THEN "Transferable"
    ELSE "Weakly Related"
```

### Overall Match Percentage

```
Overall_Match = Σ(Best_Compatibility(job_skill_i)) / Number_of_Job_Skills
```
Where Best_Compatibility(job_skill_i) is the highest compatibility score between job_skill_i and any candidate skill.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Text Processing**: Use NLP techniques for extraction (entity recognition, semantic similarity)
2. **Ontological Classification**: Deploy classifiers for skill categorization
3. **Weighting**: Initially set weights based on domain-specific importance, refine through calibration
4. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust thresholds for relationship type determination based on empirical results
5. **Scalability**: Design for efficient processing of multiple CVs against multiple job postings

## Performance Evaluation

1. **Accuracy**: Compare system recommendations against expert human evaluations
2. **Consistency**: Ensure similar CVs/jobs yield similar results
3. **Explainability**: Verify that reasoning is clear and justifiable
4. **Efficiency**: Measure processing time for different CV/job sizes
