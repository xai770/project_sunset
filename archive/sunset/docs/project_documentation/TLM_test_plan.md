```

### 7.4 Monitoring and Reporting

1. Implement test result collection and reporting
2. Create dashboards for test coverage and success rates
3. Monitor TLM performance metrics across test runs
4. Track API success rates and browser automation reliability

## 8. Test Execution Strategy

### 8.1 Prioritized Testing Schedule

The test execution will follow this prioritized schedule:

| Priority | Component | Frequency | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | API Integration | Daily | Critical for data acquisition |
| 2 | TLM Job Extraction | Daily | Core functionality for job processing |
| 3 | Domain Overlap | Weekly | Essential for skill matching |
| 4 | Browser Scraping | Weekly | Important but more stable component |
| 5 | Integration Tests | Bi-weekly | Verify system cohesion |
| 6 | End-to-End Tests | Monthly | Complete system validation |

### 8.2 Testing Environment

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local TLM framework with Ollama
   - Testing against dev API endpoints
   - Limited job counts (5-10)
   - Firefox must be running for browser automation tests

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Full TLM implementation
   - Testing against production API with test accounts
   - Medium job counts (20-30)
   - Firefox instance with pre-configured cookie preferences

3. **Production Validation**
   - Controlled tests in production
   - Limited to specific test jobs
   - Full monitoring of performance
   - Pre-authenticated Firefox session for reliable testing

> **IMPORTANT**: As of May 12, 2025, our browser automation approach requires Firefox to be already running before test execution. This allows reliable tab management and cookie persistence.

## 11. Job Description Extraction Workflow (May 2025)

### 11.1 Job Description Processing Pipeline

We've implemented a streamlined job description extraction process that separates concerns and increases reliability:

1. **Three-Step Process**
   - **Step 1:** Create JSON with DB Website API data (job metadata)
   - **Step 2:** Scrape the webpage with job description using Firefox tab automation (raw HTML content)
   - **Step 3:** Process scraped text through Ollama LLM to extract clean job description

2. **Job Description Extraction Approaches**
   - **Direct Ollama Extraction:** Uses Ollama with the phi3 model for efficient extraction
   - **TLM Framework Extraction:** Uses our TLM framework (less reliable in some cases)
   - **Fallback Extraction:** Rule-based extraction when LLM extraction fails
   - **All approaches store the clean description directly in the job JSON**

3. **Command Sequence for Testing**
   ```bash
   # 1. Fetch job metadata from API
   cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset
   python scripts/career_pipeline/fetch_and_save_jobs.py --max-jobs 5
   
   # 2. Scrape job details with Firefox tab automation
   python scripts/standalone_job_scraper.py --max-jobs 3
   
   # 3. Extract and clean job descriptions using Ollama
   python scripts/job_description_cleaner.py --max-jobs 3
   
   # 4. Verify extraction results
   jq -r '.web_details.clean_description' data/postings/job*.json | head -20
   ```

4. **Implementation Benefits**
   - Clear separation of concerns between API data, raw HTML scraping, and description extraction
   - Multiple extraction methods with fallbacks for reliability
   - Clean descriptions stored directly in job JSON files for easier access
   - Structured output format with consistent sections (title, responsibilities, requirements)

### 11.2 Enhanced Browser Automation Strategy

We've significantly improved our approach to browser automation for job description extraction:

1. **Firefox Tab Management System**
   - Created a robust `firefox_tab_manager.py` utility that:
     - Properly detects if Firefox is already running
     - Opens URLs in new tabs of existing Firefox instances
     - Manages tab lifecycle without disrupting the browser session
     - Gracefully handles tab closure after content extraction

2. **Content Extraction Improvement**
   - Implemented a more reliable content extraction mechanism using:
     - System clipboard integration with xdotool for keyboard automation
     - Ctrl+A (select all) and Ctrl+C (copy) sequence for reliable content capture
     - Platform-specific clipboard access methods for Linux, macOS, and Windows

3. **Test Improvements**
   - Created simple browser test script (`tests/fixtures/job_acquisition/simple_browser_test.py`) that validates:
     - Firefox instance detection
     - URL opening in new tab
     - Content extraction via clipboard
     - Tab closure while keeping Firefox running
   - Added structured content storage mechanism for scraped job details
   - This script (`simple_browser_test.py`) is the reference implementation that has been successfully integrated into the career pipeline via:
     - A new `firefox_tab_extractor.py` module in the career pipeline
     - Updates to the `job_detail_extractor.py` to use the Firefox tab approach as priority
     - Verification through a test script at `tests/job_acquisition/test_firefox_extraction.py`

### 11.2 Benefits of New Approach

This improved approach offers several advantages over the previous implementation:

1. **Improved Reliability**
   - Single browser session eliminates repeated cookie prompts and login requirements
   - Direct clipboard access provides more reliable content extraction than DOM parsing
   - Separate tab management prevents interference between job scraping operations
   
2. **Successful Integration**
   - The approach has been successfully integrated into the career pipeline
   - Job extraction now first attempts the Firefox tab method before falling back to other methods
   - Testing confirms that the integration preserves all benefits of the original approach
   
3. **Implementation Details** (Added May 12, 2025)
   - Created `firefox_tab_extractor.py` in career pipeline that implements our proven approach
   - Modified `job_detail_extractor.py` to use Firefox tab extraction as the primary method
   - Updated the orchestrator to inform users about Firefox requirements
   - Developed a test script (`test_firefox_extraction.py`) to verify correct integration

2. **Better Testing Capabilities**
   - Tests can now verify each component of the browser interaction independently
   - Visual verification of browser state is easier with persistent browser instance
   - More reliable content extraction leads to more consistent test results

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Clear separation between browser management and content extraction
   - Platform-specific handling improves cross-platform compatibility
   - Modular design allows for easier updates as browser interfaces change

## 12. Job Description Extraction Optimization (May 12, 2025)

### 12.1 Extraction Quality Improvements

We've significantly enhanced our job description extraction process with better prompt engineering and multiple extraction methods:

   - Created `job_description_cleaner.py` with robust extraction capabilities
   - Implemented validation to ensure high-quality job descriptions
   - Added fallback extraction methods for when LLM extraction fails
   - Supports both adding clean descriptions and replacing raw HTML

2. **LLM Prompt Engineering**
   - Developed structured prompts that guide LLMs to extract specific job components
   - Format job descriptions into consistent sections (title, location, responsibilities, requirements)
   - Filter out navigation elements, company boilerplate, and marketing content
   - Preserve the original language (English or German) of the job posting

3. **Multiple Extraction Methods**
   - **Primary:** Ollama with phi3 model for efficient and accurate extraction
   - **Secondary:** TLM framework for consistency with other processes
   - **Fallback:** Rule-based parsing when LLM extraction fails or returns irrelevant content
   - **Storage:** Options to either add clean_description field or replace raw HTML

### 12.2 Extraction Quality Testing

To ensure optimal extraction quality, we've implemented a structured testing approach:

1. **Extraction Quality Metrics**
   - **Completeness:** Extraction of all essential job details
   - **Relevance:** Exclusion of non-essential content

   - Metrics tracked include extraction quality, processing time, and reliability
   - Test results stored in `data/test_results/llm_extraction_comparisons/`
   - Framework supports comparing multiple models (phi3, llama3, mistral) and prompt variations
   - Automated evaluation of output quality using predefined criteria

3. **Recommended LLM Configuration**
   - **Model:** Ollama with phi3 (best balance of speed and accuracy)
   - **Prompt Structure:** Specific instruction to extract title, location, responsibilities, and requirements
   - **Output Format:** Clean text with appropriate section breaks
   - **Validation:** Ensures output contains expected sections and reasonable content length

### 12.3 Prompt Testing Strategy (May 12-13, 2025)

We've developed a comprehensive strategy for testing and comparing different prompts and LLMs, with a robust implementation completed on May 13, 2025:

     ```
   - **Context-Enhanced:** Extraction with domain-specific context about job postings
     ```
     You are a specialized job description parser for Deutsche Bank careers website.
     Your task is to extract essential job information from raw HTML/text content while filtering out 
     navigation elements, marketing content, and other non-essential information.
     ```
   - **Two-Stage:** First identifying structure, then filling in content
     ```
     STAGE 1: First, I'll identify the main sections of the job posting.
     STAGE 2: Then, I'll extract the relevant content for each section.
     ```
   - **Precision-Focused:** Emphasis on accuracy over completeness
     ```
     Extract ONLY the essential job information from this posting with high precision:
     1. Extract the EXACT job title as written
     2. Extract ONLY responsibilities that are explicitly stated
     3. Extract ONLY requirements/qualifications that are explicitly stated
     4. Do NOT infer or add any details not directly stated in the text
