# Qualification Narrative Issues and Fixes

## Initial Issue (May 6, 2025)
My score in data/postings/job61951.json is 0, yet this is wrong:

```json
"qualification_narrative": "Based on my professional experience, I am partially qualified for the Tax Senior Specialist (d/m/w) role. My professional background aligns well with the requirements, positioning me to contribute effectively from day one.",
```

## Ollama API Connection Fix (May 7, 2025)

### Problem Identified
The skill decomposer module was failing with 404 errors when trying to connect to Ollama's API endpoints. Terminal logs showed:
```
[GIN] 2025/05/06 - 22:36:18 | 404 | 1.075985ms | 127.0.0.1 | POST "/api/generate"
[GIN] 2025/05/06 - 22:36:18 | 404 | 105.446µs | 127.0.0.1 | POST "/api/generate" 
[GIN] 2025/05/06 - 22:36:18 | 404 | 183.744µs | 127.0.0.1 | POST "/api/chat"
[GIN] 2025/05/06 - 22:36:18 | 404 | 107.016µs | 127.0.0.1 | POST "/api/chat"
```

### Root Cause
Ollama server was running properly (version 0.6.8), but no models were installed. This caused the API endpoints to return 404 errors when trying to access non-existent models.

### Solution Implemented
1. Installed the llama3.2 model using `ollama pull llama3.2`
2. Verified API functionality with a test script (`test_ollama_simulation.py`)
3. Updated E2E documentation with Ollama model installation instructions and notes about normal warning messages

### Verification
1. Ran the orchestrator with 5 test jobs: 
   ```
   cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset && python tests/end_to_end/run_orchestrator.py --max-jobs 5 --output-dir ./data/postings
   ```
2. Results showed successful skill decomposition for 4 out of 5 jobs (one timed out)
3. The logs confirmed successful API calls with messages like:
   ```
   root - INFO - Trying model llama3.2:latest for JSON generation
   root - INFO - Model llama3.2:latest returned valid JSON
   root - INFO - Successfully used model llama3.2:latest to decompose job 61964
   ```

### Latest Results
- Job 61951 (Tax Senior Specialist): Now showing 33.3% match score (previously 0%)
- Job 61964 (Tax Senior Analyst): 100% match score
- Job 62914 (Senior Site Reliability Engineer): 100% match score
- Job 63141 (Senior Procurement Manager): 100% match score

### Note
The warning messages in Ollama logs about `key not found key=general.alignment default=32` are normal and don't affect functionality.

## Next Steps
- Consider installing additional backup models for cases when llama3.2 times out
- Investigate the mismatch between the qualification narrative text ("partially qualified") and the match score for job61951.json (33.3%)
