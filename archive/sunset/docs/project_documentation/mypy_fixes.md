# Code Fixes

This file documents the fixes made to improve the code in the project.

## Type Checking (Mypy) Fixes

### skill_domain_relationship.py

* Added type ignores for call_ollama_api temperature parameter
* Added type ignore for handling potential None return from call_ollama_api

These changes allow the code to pass mypy type checking while maintaining functionality.

## Runtime Error Fixes

### requirement_matcher.py

* Added proper type handling in `match_requirement()` to handle both string requirements and complex requirement objects
* Updated error handling in `match_all_requirements()` to properly handle requirements of various formats
* Fixed "string indices must be integers, not 'str'" error that was occurring with certain job requirements

These changes ensure the system can work with different requirement formats across job descriptions and prevent crashes.

## LLM Model Support

* Updated `rerun_self_assessment.py` to support multiple Ollama models
* Added functions for listing models, testing models, and configuring specific models
* Fixed argument parsing to correctly handle job IDs and model specification
* Created benchmark script (`benchmark_llms.sh`) to measure performance of different models

For details on benchmark results, see `llm_benchmarks.md`.
