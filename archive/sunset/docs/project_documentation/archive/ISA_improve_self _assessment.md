# Improving Self-Assessment System in Project Sunset

## Implementation Progress (Updated May 6, 2025)

### What We've Accomplished

We've successfully addressed several key issues that were affecting the self-assessment system:

1. **Fixed Module Dependencies**: Corrected import errors in the system by ensuring proper imports between components and updating file path references.

2. **Evidence Integration**: Enhanced the evidence extraction system to pull concrete examples from CV data rather than generate placeholder text.

3. **Development Recommendations**: Improved the development area advice to provide more specific and actionable recommendations based on job requirements.

4. **Narrative Generation**: Enhanced narrative generation with industry-specific content and better evidence integration.

5. **Successful Testing**: Created and executed test cases that verify the self-assessment generation works as expected.

6. **Version Control System**: Added version tracking for self-assessments to enable automatic updates when the assessment algorithm improves.

7. **Hiring Manager Perspective Scoring**: Implemented a sophisticated scoring algorithm that simulates how hiring managers evaluate candidates, with context-aware weighting of skills based on job type.

### Recent Technical Improvements

1. **Enhanced `evidence_extractor.py`**:
   - Fixed critical import issues
   - Improved the function to get meaningful evidence from CV data
   - Added proper typing annotations and error handling
   - Added support for extracting specific achievements and recent examples
   - Implemented supporting skills identification from CV data

2. **Refactored `narrative_generator.py`**:
   - Updated to use available evidence extraction functions
   - Enhanced qualification details with concrete CV evidence
   - Improved narrative generation with job field detection

3. **Fixed Formatting Issues**: 
   - Synchronized field naming between components
   - Updated formatters to match the actual data structure

4. **Testing Framework**:
   - Created comprehensive test suite for the self-assessment controller
   - Successfully tested with actual job data (Job ID 62177)

5. **Version Control**:
   - Added assessment versioning to track algorithm improvements
   - Implemented automatic detection and regeneration of outdated assessments
   - Provided consistency across all job postings

6. **Advanced Matching Algorithm** (May 5, 2025):
   - Implemented `calculate_advanced_match_score` function that better reflects hiring manager evaluation
   - Added job-type specific weighting (technical, management, analyst roles)
   - Applied penalties for moderate matches (0.6-0.8 strength) to better reflect real-world evaluation
   - Prioritized critical requirements mentioned in job title
   - Created testing framework to compare original vs. hiring manager perspective scores
   - Updated self-assessment generator to use advanced scores (version 1.2.0)

7. **Fixed Path References and Import Chain** (May 6, 2025):
   - Removed incorrect references to `CONSOLIDATED_JOBS_DIR` across all modules
   - Updated all job file operations to work directly with the `postings_DIR` path
   - Added missing `find_job_file` function to utils.py for proper file location
   - Fixed missing imports and incorrectly named functions in the skill_decomposer module
   - Implemented missing search functions in the searcher.py module
   - Fixed the core.py module to properly support elementary component operations
   - Successfully executed all self-assessment controller tests

## Enhanced Matching Algorithm Details

Our new hiring manager perspective algorithm addresses a key issue: traditional matching algorithms treat all requirements equally and don't penalize moderate matches enough. Our improved approach:

1. **Role-specific weighting**:
   - Technical roles prioritize cloud, security, development, and architectural skills
   - Management roles prioritize leadership, strategy, and stakeholder management
   - Analyst roles prioritize analytical, reporting, and process skills

2. **Critical requirement detection**:
   - Requirements mentioned in the job title receive 50% higher weight
   - Complex requirements with multiple elementary skills receive 20% higher weight

3. **Match strength penalties**:
   - Moderate matches (0.6-0.8) receive a 20% penalty
   - Weak matches (<0.6) receive a 40% penalty

4. **Self-assessment impact**:
   - Critical requirements with only moderate matches are downgraded to "development areas"
   - Overall scores better reflect the hiring manager's likely evaluation
   - Testing has shown score adjustments of 15-40% compared to basic matching

## Previous Issues (For Reference)

After analyzing the self-assessment system in Project Sunset, the following issues have been identified:

1. **Empty Evidence Summaries**: The system identifies skill matches but produces placeholder text like "Demonstrated expertise in ." without actual evidence from the CV.

2. **Inconsistent Scoring**: Match scores in `match_summary` section don't always align with scores in the `self_assessment` section.

3. **Generic Development Recommendations**: The system provides generic advice like "Identify training opportunities to develop X" rather than specific, actionable insights.

4. **Missing Contextual Relevance**: The system doesn't connect specific CV achievements to job requirements.

5. **Incomplete Narrative Generation**: The qualification narrative lacks depth and specific references to relevant experience.

## Original Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Evidence Integration

**Objective**: Fill in evidence summaries with concrete examples from the CV.

**Tasks**:
1. Modify `generator.py` to extract relevant experience snippets from the CV matching each skill
2. Update `narrative_generator.py` to create compelling evidence summaries using this data
3. Add logic to reference specific job roles and achievements from the CV
4. Create a function to prioritize the most relevant/recent evidence

**Implementation**:
```python
# Example improvement to generate_qualification_details in narrative_generator.py
def generate_qualification_details(matches, cv_data):
    qualifications = []
    for requirement, match_data in matches:
        skill = match_data.get('your_skill', 'Unknown skill')
        match_strength = match_data.get('match_strength', 0)
        
        # Extract relevant experience from CV based on the matched skill
        evidence = extract_skill_evidence(cv_data, skill)
        
        qualification = {
            'requirement': requirement,
            'skill': skill,
            'match_strength': match_strength,
            'supporting_skills': [],
            'evidence_summary': generate_evidence_summary(evidence, requirement)
        }
        qualifications.append(qualification)
    return qualifications
```

### Phase 2: Score Synchronization

**Objective**: Ensure consistent scoring across all job file sections.

**Tasks**:
1. Add validation between `match_summary` and `self_assessment` sections
2. Create a synchronized update mechanism that updates both sections simultaneously
3. Add tests to verify score consistency

**Implementation**:
```python
# Add to utils/self_assessment/generator.py
def synchronize_scores(job_data):
    """Ensure match scores are consistent across job data sections"""
    if 'matches' in job_data and 'match_summary' in job_data and 'self_assessment' in job_data:
        # Get the score from matches section (source of truth)
        overall_score = job_data['matches'].get('overall_match', 0)
        
        # Update match_summary
        job_data['match_summary']['overall_match'] = overall_score
        
        # Update self_assessment 
        job_data['self_assessment']['overall_match_score'] = overall_score
        
    return job_data
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Narrative Generation

**Objective**: Create more detailed, context-aware narratives that highlight specific experiences.

**Tasks**:
1. Improve `generate_narrative` function to incorporate specific CV accomplishments
2. Add variability to narrative templates based on job industry and role type
3. Include more specific references to matching skills with examples
4. Create more nuanced strength levels beyond strong/moderate/weak

**Implementation**:
```python
# Improve narrative generation with specific CV references
def generate_narrative(job_title, job_field, overall_match, strong_matches, 
                      moderate_matches, weak_matches, missing_skills, cv_data):
    # Industry-specific opening statements
    if "IT" in job_field or "Technology" in job_field:
        narrative = f"With my technical background and experience, I am {get_match_level_phrase(overall_match)} for the {job_title} role. "
    elif "Finance" in job_field:
        narrative = f"My experience in financial systems and processes makes me {get_match_level_phrase(overall_match)} for the {job_title} position. "
    else:
        narrative = f"Based on my professional experience, I am {get_match_level_phrase(overall_match)} for the {job_title} role. "
    
    # Add references to specific achievements
    if strong_matches:
        skill = strong_matches[0][0]
        achievement = find_most_relevant_achievement(cv_data, skill)
        narrative += f"My expertise in {skill} is demonstrated by {achievement}, which directly aligns with your requirements. "
        
    # Continue with remaining narrative logic...
```

### Phase 4: Contextual Relevance Enhancement

**Objective**: Better connect candidates' experience to specific job requirements.

**Tasks**:
1. Add semantic analysis to identify transferrable skills
2. Implement bidirectional mapping between CV achievements and job requirements
3. Add weighting for recency and relevance of experiences
4. Create a mechanism to handle domain-specific terminology

**Technical Implementation**:
1. Use CV experience duration to weight relevance of skills
2. Create a more sophisticated semantic matching algorithm for skills
3. Add a system to track company/industry-specific terminology

### Phase 5: Development Area Improvements

**Objective**: Provide more actionable development recommendations.

**Tasks**:
1. Update the development area generation to provide specific, actionable advice
2. Link development areas to learning resources when possible
3. Suggest transferable skills that could help address development areas
4. Add a growth timeline estimation for acquiring missing skills
