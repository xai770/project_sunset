  ├── elementary_skills.json     # Repository of elementary skills with domains and synonyms

```

## Skills Decomposer Module

The skill decomposer has been refactored from a single script into a modular package located at `/scripts/utils/skill_decomposer/`. The package provides these key functions:

1. **Decomposing skills** from your CV into elementary components:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli decompose "Skill Name" --description "Skill description"
   ```

2. **Decomposing job requirements** from job postings:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli job JOB_ID
   ```

3. **Matching your skills** against job requirements:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli match JOB_ID
   ```

4. **Generating match summaries** with recommendations:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli summary JOB_ID
   ```

5. **Generating detailed reports**:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli report JOB_ID
   ```

Or alternatively, you can import and use the module in your Python code:

```python
from scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.decomposition import decompose_skill, decompose_job_requirements
from scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.matching import find_skill_matches, get_job_match_summary
from scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.visualization import generate_job_match_report

# Decompose a skill
elementary_skills = decompose_skill("Project Management", "Coordinating and managing projects")

# Decompose job requirements
job = decompose_job_requirements("12345")

# Match skills with a job
match_results = find_skill_matches("12345")  

# Generate a summary
summary = get_job_match_summary("12345")

# Generate a report
report_path = generate_job_match_report("12345")
```

## CV Inference for Undocumented Skills

The system now automatically analyzes your CV text when a job requirement doesn't match any documented skills. This process:

1. Checks for previously validated inferred skills that match the requirement
2. If no validated skill matches, extracts the elementary skills needed for the job requirement
3. Uses Ollama to analyze your CV for evidence of these skills
4. Determines if you likely have the skill based on your experience
5. Provides confidence levels (high/medium/low) for inferred skills
6. Includes specific evidence from your CV to support the inference

This feature is particularly valuable for:
- Identifying transferable skills from previous roles
- Recognizing skills that were applied but not explicitly listed
- Finding evidence of skills developed through projects or education
- Maintaining consistency by reusing previously validated skills

You can disable this feature with the `--no-cv-analysis` flag:
```bash
python scripts/utils/skill_decomposer.py match --job-id JOB_ID --no-cv-analysis
```

## Automatic Job Analysis with Scraper Integration

The skill decomposer is now fully integrated with the job scraper workflow. When new jobs are discovered and scraped, the system will automatically:

1. Create job decomposition files (using manual mode to avoid Ollama API issues)
2. Match the job requirements against your skills
3. Generate match summaries and reports

This integration ensures that all newly discovered jobs are immediately analyzed for skill matches, making it easier to quickly identify promising job opportunities.

If automatic decomposition fails (e.g., due to API issues), the system creates placeholder decomposition files that can be manually edited later.

## Self-Assessment Generation

The self-assessment generator has been refactored into a modular package located at `/scripts/utils/self_assessment/`. The package provides improved narrative generation that adapts to match percentages:

1. The narrative tone now adjusts based on match percentage:
   - ≥80%: "I am exceptionally qualified"
   - ≥60%: "I am well-qualified"
   - ≥40%: "I have relevant qualifications"
   - ≥20%: "My background offers some alignment"
   - <20%: "My current skillset has limited overlap"

2. The module structure follows clean architecture principles:
   - `generator.py`: Core assessment generation logic
   - `narrative_generator.py`: Text generation with adaptive language
   - `formatters.py`: Output formatting for markdown, text, and HTML
   - `data_loader.py`: Data loading and saving operations

3. Usage from command line:
   ```bash
   cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset
   python scripts/utils/self_assessment_cli.py --job-id 62177 --markdown
   ```

4. Usage in Python code:
   ```python
   from scripts.utils.self_assessment import SelfAssessmentGenerator
   
   # Create generator for a specific job
   generator = SelfAssessmentGenerator("62177")
   
   # Load data and generate assessment
   if generator.load_data():
       assessment = generator.generate_assessment()
       
       # Get markdown representation
       markdown = generator.get_assessment_markdown()
       print(markdown)
       
       # Add to job profile
       generator.add_to_job_profile()
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with existing workflow**:
   - ✓ Add skill decomposition step after job scraping (implemented)
   - ✓ Use match results to enhance self-assessment generation (implemented)
   - Incorporate match recommendations into cover letter generation

2. **Enhancements**:
   - ✓ Add semantic matching for similar skills with different terminology (implemented)
   - ✓ Improve synonym handling in the elementary skills database (completed)
   - ✓ Add visualization of match results (implemented)
   - ✓ Analyze CV text for undocumented skills (implemented)
   - ✓ Integrate with validated inferred skills (implemented)
   - ✓ Fix bug in prioritize_skills_for_comparison function for list inputs (implemented)
   - Fix inconsistency in summary reporting of matched requirements
   - Improve the visualization of skill matches with interactive features

3. **Testing with more jobs**:
   - ✓ Apply to a broader range of job postings (ongoing)
   - Create benchmarks for different job types

## Usage Examples

**Example 1**: Add a new skill from your CV:
```bash
cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset
python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli decompose "Strategic Vendor Management" --description "Managing strategic vendor relationships and negotiations"
```

**Example 2**: Analyze a job posting:
```bash
cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset
python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli job 62940
python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli match 62940
python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli summary 62940 > job62940_match_summary.md
python -m scripts.utils.skill_decomposer.cli report 62940
```
