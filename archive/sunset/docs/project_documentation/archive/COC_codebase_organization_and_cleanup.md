# Codebase Organization and Cleanup

This document outlines our plan and tracks progress for the cleanup and reorganization of Project Sunset's codebase. The goal is to improve maintainability, readability, and ensure we only keep what is actively needed.

## Goals

1. **Identify Core Functionality**: Determine which scripts and modules are actively used in the main pipeline
2. **Remove or Archive Legacy Code**: Move unused code to an archive directory to avoid confusion
3. **Improve Organization**: Ensure files are located in logical directories with proper naming
4. **Document Dependencies**: Create a clear map of dependencies between modules
5. **Rename Misleading Components**: Give components names that accurately reflect their purpose

### Key Findings

#### Main Pipeline Components

1. **Command-line Interface**: `cli.py` serves as the main command-line entry point
   - Provides argument parsing for controlling the scraper
   - Sets up logging based on verbosity settings
   - Calls `run_scraper()` function from `scraper.py`

2. **Orchestrator**: `scraper.py` coordinates the entire scraping process
   - Sets up logging and configuration
   - Fetches jobs from the Deutsche Bank careers API via `job_fetcher.py`
   - Extracts detailed job information via `job_detail_extractor.py`
   - Processes and saves jobs via `job_processor/core.py`
   - Optionally runs skill decomposition and self-assessment
   - Generates reports if requested

3. **Job Processing**: `job_processor/core.py` handles job data transformation
   - Processes raw job data and enriches it with details
   - Creates consolidated job structures
   - Saves jobs to individual JSON files
   - Triggers skill decomposition for new jobs
   - Generates daily summary files

4. **Skill Analysis**: Utility modules in `skill_decomposer` folder
   - Decomposes job requirements into individual skills
   - Matches profile skills against job requirements
   - Calculates match scores
   - Provides semantic matching capabilities

5. **Self-Assessment**: Utility modules in `self_assessment` folder
   - Generates evidence-based self-assessments
   - Creates narratives for skill matches
   - Integrates with the job data
   - Organizes assessment data for presentation

6. **Cover Letter Generation**: `generate_cover_letter.py`
   - Template-based cover letter generation
   - Interactive mode for custom cover letters
   - Skill bullet selection for tailored content
   - Profile storage for repeated use

#### Naming Issue

The name "job_scraper" is indeed misleading as the module does much more than just scraping:
1. It fetches job data
2. It processes and enriches job information
3. It performs skill analysis and decomposition
4. It generates self-assessments
5. It creates reports
6. It can generate cover letters

A more appropriate name would be "career_pipeline" or "job_processor" as these better reflect the complete processing pipeline the module represents.

#### Likely Unused/Legacy Code

*To be filled in after further analysis*

## Naming Suggestions

For the `job_scraper` module, potential new names:
- `career_pipeline` - ‚≠ê Recommended as it captures the end-to-end pipeline nature
- `job_processor` - Reflects the data processing aspects but misses some functionality
- `opportunity_manager` - Too vague and doesn't clearly convey technical functionality
- `job_analysis_engine` - Too focused on analysis when the system does much more
- `career_toolkit` - Too broad and doesn't reflect the automated pipeline nature

## Technical Debt Notes

1. **Import Issues**: Mix of relative and absolute imports in the codebase
   - scraper.py adds parent directory to sys.path which is generally discouraged
   - Some modules use relative imports (.module) while others use absolute (scripts.module)

2. **Documentation Inconsistencies**: 
   - Some modules have detailed DATA FLOW documentation at the top
   - Others have minimal or no documentation

3. **Directory Structure**:
   - Some utility functions in job_scraper/utils/ overlap with scripts/utils/
   - Could benefit from consolidation

4. **Ollama API Timeout Issues**: 
   - Career pipeline experiences Ollama API timeouts during skill decomposition
   - Tests like benchmark_translator.py work fine with the same Ollama setup
   - Need better error handling and retry mechanisms for LLM API calls
   - Current timeout settings may be insufficient for complex prompts

5. **Duplicate Utility Directories**:
   - We have both `scripts/career_pipeline/utils` and `scripts/utils` 
   - Need to evaluate whether these should be consolidated
   - Consider moving specialized utilities to their relevant module and general utilities to a central location

*More items will be added as we discover them*

## Potential Archive Candidates

After reviewing the codebase, we've identified the following categories of files:

### Active Core Components
These files are essential parts of the main workflow and should remain in the primary codebase:
- `cli.py` - Main command-line interface
- `scraper.py` - Core orchestrator
- `job_fetcher.py` - Fetches jobs from the API
- `job_detail_extractor.py` - Extracts detailed job information
- `job_processor/` directory - Core processing logic
- `api_access_tester.py` - Tests site access and handles IP rotation
- `json_to_word.py` - Converts job data to Word format
- `md_to_word_converter.py` - Converts Markdown cover letters to Word format
- `generate_cover_letter.py` - Creates cover letters based on templates

### Supporting Utilities
These files support the main workflow but might be used less frequently:
- `report_generator.py` - Creates reports based on job data
- `email_sender.py` - Email functionality for sending applications

### Pending Evaluation
These files need further evaluation to determine if they're actively used:
- Any scripts in `job_scraper/utils/` that might duplicate functionality in `scripts/utils/`
- Test files that might be outdated or failing
- Any scripts without clear documentation or imports from other modules

### Next Steps for Identification
1. Check for duplicate utility functions between `job_scraper/utils/` and `scripts/utils/`
2. Examine test files to determine which ones are passing and current
3. Look for scripts without imports from other modules (potential standalone utilities)
4. Check for outdated documentation that doesn't match current behavior

Once we've completed this identification process, we can create an `archive/` directory and begin moving unused files there, updating imports as needed.

## Utility Analysis Results

After examining the utility modules in `scripts/job_scraper/utils/`, we've found:

1. **html_utils.py** - Contains specialized functions for:
   - Cleaning HTML content from Deutsche Bank job postings
   - Extracting structured data from job descriptions
   - Formatting job content with proper sections and bullet points
   - Handling the unique format of Deutsche Bank job listings

2. **network_utils.py** - Provides network-related functionality:
   - User agent rotation for web requests
   - IP address detection
   - VPN connection management for IP rotation
   - Tools for avoiding rate limiting during scraping

These utilities are specialized for the job scraping functionality and don't duplicate the more general utilities in the main `scripts/utils/` directory. They should be retained and moved as part of the module renaming process.

## Module Renaming Plan

Based on our analysis, we're recommending renaming the `job_scraper` module to `career_pipeline`. Here's our implementation plan:

### Step 1: Create New Directory Structure
```
scripts/career_pipeline/
    __init__.py
    cli.py
    job_processor/
    utils/
        __init__.py
        html_utils.py
        network_utils.py
    ... (other files from job_scraper)
```

### Step 2: Update Imports in Moved Files
For each file moved to the new directory, we'll need to update imports from:
- `from scripts.job_scraper...` to `from scripts.career_pipeline...`
- `from job_scraper...` to `from career_pipeline...`
- Relative imports like `from .job_fetcher` remain unchanged

### Step 3: Update External References
Identify and update all external references to job_scraper in:
- Other modules (especially in scripts/utils/)
- Test files
- Documentation

### Step 4: Verify Functionality
After the rename:
- Run tests to verify functionality
- Test the main command-line interface
- Test key features like job processing, skill decomposition, and cover letter generation

### Step 5: Update Documentation
- Update any references to "job_scraper" in documentation
- Add a note about the renaming in README files

This plan will ensure a smooth transition to the new module name while maintaining full functionality.

## Component Refactoring Plan

### File Size Management and Module Splitting

During the migration process, we've identified that some files are excessively large and should be split into smaller, more focused modules. This will improve maintainability and make the code easier to understand.

#### job_detail_extractor.py (646 lines) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

The `job_detail_extractor.py` file was successfully refactored on May 6, 2025. The file was split into three smaller, more focused modules as planned:

1. **job_detail_extractor.py** (core file)
   - Main interface and orchestration functions
   - Configuration and constants 
   - Top-level extraction function (`fetch_job_detail`)
   - Reduced from 646 lines to approximately 150 lines

2. **browser_automation.py** (new file in utils/)
   - Browser automation utilities
   - Functions like `extract_job_details_with_browser`
   - Browser detection and management
   - Process handling and cleanup
   - Approximately 250 lines

3. **content_parser.py** (new file in utils/)
   - HTML and text content parsing
   - Section extraction from job descriptions
   - Functions like `parse_browser_extracted_content`
   - `extract_job_details_from_html`
   - Approximately 250 lines

The refactoring was verified with a test script (`tests/test_job_detail_extractor.py`) which confirmed that all functionality works correctly with the new modular structure. The code is now more maintainable, easier to test, and each module has a single responsibility.

#### scraper.py (293 lines) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

The `scraper.py` file was successfully refactored on May 6, 2025. The file was split into four smaller, more focused modules:

1. **scraper.py** (core file)
   - Main orchestration functions
   - Core workflow logic
   - Primary interfaces to other components
   - Reduced from 293 lines to approximately 126 lines

2. **utils/scraper_config.py** (new file)
   - Logging setup functions
   - Configuration constants
   - Output path generation
   - Approximately 80 lines

3. **utils/job_repair.py** (new file)
   - Job repair functionality
   - Enhanced job detail fetching with retry logic
   - Integration with skill decomposer
   - Approximately 127 lines  

4. **cli.py** (enhanced existing file)
   - Command-line interface
   - Argument parsing and handling
   - Result output formatting
   - Approximately 120 lines

During this refactoring process, we also created several adapter files to maintain compatibility during the transition from `job_scraper` to `career_pipeline`. These adapters allow the refactored code to access functions from their original locations while the migration is in progress.

The refactoring was verified with a test script (`tests/test_refactored_scraper.py`) which confirmed that all functionality works correctly with the new modular structure. The code is now more maintainable, easier to understand, and each module has a clearer single responsibility.

#### job_processor/core.py (166 lines) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

The `job_processor/core.py` file was successfully refactored on May 6, 2025. The file was split into three smaller, more focused modules as planned:

1. **job_processor/core.py** (reduced)
   - Main orchestration function
   - High-level workflow control
   - Reduced from 166 lines to approximately 69 lines

2. **job_processor/file_handler.py** (new file)
   - File existence checking
   - Reading existing job files
   - Saving consolidated job data
   - Daily summary file management
   - Approximately 63 lines

3. **job_processor/enrichment.py** (new file)
   - Job data enrichment logic
   - Integration with detail fetcher
   - Processing of API descriptions
   - Skill decomposer integration
   - Approximately 55 lines

This refactoring improved maintainability by separating the core orchestration logic from file handling and data enrichment concerns. Each module now has a clear, focused responsibility. The refactoring was verified with a test script (`tests/test_refactored_job_processor.py`) which confirmed that all functionality works correctly with the new modular structure.

The refactored code maintains all the original functionality while making it more maintainable, easier to understand, and easier to test. These improvements will make it easier to migrate this component to the new `career_pipeline` structure in the next phase.

## Summary of Progress (May 6, 2025)

We have successfully completed the following major refactoring tasks:

1. **File Size Management and Module Splitting**
