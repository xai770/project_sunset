Hi Claude,

I like your tone. 
1. Hierarchy is a law of consciousness. I hate the word btw - rule of the holy ones? Have to puke... Can you think of another term? But we all need a reviewer. Often we assume the role of that second person but having another sentient being to talk to helps a lot. This way we get consistency, we make sure we aren't dreaming and we get to reconsider what we thought we knew. Let me give you an example. If you (this session is you) start managing the LLM clinic, the legal department and jfms, your content area would fill up in no time and I would have to open a new session and re-brief another you. And while I enjoy doing it to an extent, it's not what I really want to do. Open to suggestions. 
2. Look, copying your output to local documents, so I can feed them back to you is an assistants job. Reviewing your output and telling you that you gave me the wrong document too. And with copilot, it's noticing that he thinks the script didn't generate an output while it did but copilot cannot see it, noticing that he got stuck and needs to be nudged, making sure he doesn't start implementing code we already have, telling him that a script has 500+ lines and needs to be refactored, tracking my errors, understanding why suddenly things don't work, starting new sessions... So yes, I am your assistant. Can't wait for this to change but for me it's getting what I want and that's how it currently works. Im always happy when I can hand over tasks. Told copilot today that he can backup the project with a script we have. He started doing it, I was happy. But, of course, he will forget and 8 will have to remind him. C'est la vie.
3. Sure let's create the LLM evaluation sin project. Suggest you create a requirements document and we outsource it to another Claude. But if you want to handle that yourself, I will let you. Until we see that you lose coherence. 
4. Legal aspects. Suggest you create a requirements document and we outsource this to another you etc. etc. Let me tell you why I am not worried: the unemployment agency won't limit the usage of their job data. They are state run and they really want to show that the are useful so that's good. Larhe job markets will not like this, so we try to work with them. Remember - we aren't in this for the money. If LinkedIn wants to join our public foundation, that's great. And if not, we can use a different approach..
5. Here is a different approach to get job postings: we search the web for jobs using duckduckgo, curl the pages and have a local LLM extract the posting. We build up a catalog of sites where jobs are to be found and we get them this way. I did a similar exercise looking for css endpoints and that was the first real success I had with using local LLMs integrated in scripts. 
6. ....and suppose that doesn't work out neither, what them, I hear you ask? So why bother?  Because I need the tool for my personal use. I am looking for a job, remember? This we can do. And if we can get this to limited pilot stage - Arbeitsamt data and and a few users, we have build something amazing already. Do you think this might look nice on my CV? 
7. Look, I know that the big boys are actively looking for new features they can steal from the other big boys.  But looking for a job is for losers. These guYs don't deal with loses. This isn't sexy. The jobs on the Arbeitsamt page are such, that nobody would want to take them. Bad pay, working for an agency that sells you to an agency, which works with an outsourced company for a group of  firms letc etc. Did you know that people pee into bottles at Amazon? People are working more than. 13 hours and not getting enough money to get by. Do you think Jeff bezos wants to help his bottle peeing slaves find a way off the plantation?
8. Marketing is easy. Looking for a job is horrible. You feel like a loser, a beggar, you lose hope, you are ashamed and stressed out. Having somebody help you to get your CV I in Shape, look for roles and draft cover letters is incredibly helpful. I am not sure you can understand the psychological strain. People pop piles, dri k and smoke, get fat and basically commit a slow suicide. It's horrible to watch. I have three cases I am acquainted with personally. 
9. You ask me what sub project is most important. Well, why don't you tell me what you think? Same goes for the other questions. 

Cheers
