# Fetch Module Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
- The `fetch_module.py` had an incorrect calculation for `max_jobs_to_fetch` which was limiting the number of jobs that could be fetched.
- The original code was setting `max_jobs_to_fetch = max_pages`, which meant it was using the number of pages as the limit for jobs.
- This was incorrect because the actual number of jobs should be `max_pages * results_per_page`.

## Fix Applied
In `/home/xai/Documents/sunset/run_pipeline/core/fetch_module.py`, we changed:
```python
# Original (incorrect)
max_jobs_to_fetch = max_pages  # Max number of jobs to fetch

# Fixed
max_jobs_to_fetch = max_pages * results_per_page  # Max number of jobs to fetch
```

## Results
- Successfully fetched all 61 available jobs from the Deutsche Bank API.
- All job files were correctly saved to the `/home/xai/Documents/sunset/data/postings/` directory.
- The daily summary file was also generated with information about the jobs.

## Testing
- Running the pipeline with the fix in place successfully processed all jobs without any errors.
- Using `--force-reprocess` flag ensured that we got a clean fetch of all available jobs.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the job fetching process in future runs to ensure it continues to fetch all available jobs.
- Consider adding a job count validation step to verify that all expected jobs are being processed.
