# LLM Factory Quality Monitoring Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the new quality monitoring system that tracks the performance improvements from the LLM Factory integration in Project Sunset.

## 🎯 What We're Monitoring

The system tracks quality improvements across all major LLM-powered components:

### **Monitored Components**
- **Job Matching** - Job fitness evaluation and matching percentages
- **Cover Letter Generation** - Professional cover letter creation
- **Feedback Processing** - User feedback analysis and routing
- **Skill Analysis** - Skill validation and enrichment
- **Document Analysis** - CV and job description processing

### **Key Metrics**
- **Quality Score** (0.0-1.0) - Overall output quality assessment
- **Response Time** - Processing time in seconds
- **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful operations
- **User Satisfaction** - User ratings (1-5 scale)
- **Output Length** - Size of generated content
- **Model Used** - Which LLM model processed the request
- **Specialist Used** - Which LLM Factory specialist was employed

## 📊 Performance Improvements Expected

Based on the LLM Factory integration, we expect significant improvements:

| Component | Before LLM Factory | After LLM Factory | Expected Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Cover Letters** | 40% quality (broken) | 90% quality | +125% |
| **Job Matching** | 65% accuracy | 85% accuracy | +31% |
| **Feedback Processing** | 55% basic analysis | 80% sophisticated | +45% |
| **Skill Analysis** | 60% accuracy | 75% accuracy | +25% |

## 🚀 How to Use the Monitoring System

### **1. Automatic Tracking**

The monitoring system automatically tracks all LLM Factory operations. No code changes needed - just use the integrated components normally.

### **2. Manual Quality Reporting**

Track user satisfaction:

```python
from monitoring.performance_integration import log_user_satisfaction

# After a user reviews a cover letter
log_user_satisfaction("cover_letter_generation", "generate", satisfaction_rating=5)

# After a user evaluates job matching
log_user_satisfaction("job_matching", "evaluate", satisfaction_rating=4)
```

### **3. Generate Reports**

#### Daily Report
```bash
cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset
python monitoring/llm_factory_performance_monitor.py
```

#### Custom Reports
```python
from monitoring.llm_factory_performance_monitor import LLMFactoryPerformanceMonitor

monitor = LLMFactoryPerformanceMonitor()

# Generate weekly report
monitor.print_performance_summary(days_back=7)

# Generate monthly report
monitor.print_performance_summary(days_back=30)

# Analyze specific component
report = monitor.analyze_component_performance("cover_letter_generation", days_back=7)
print(f"Cover Letter Quality: {report.avg_quality_score:.2f}")
print(f"Quality Improvement: {report.quality_improvement:.1f}%")
```

### **4. Collect Baseline Metrics**

Establish current performance baselines:

```bash
cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset
python monitoring/collect_baseline_metrics.py
```

## 📈 Reading Performance Reports

### **Quality Score Interpretation**
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent quality, professional output
- **0.7-0.8**: Good quality, minor improvements possible
- **0.5-0.6**: Acceptable quality, significant room for improvement
- **0.0-0.4**: Poor quality, major issues present

### **Response Time Benchmarks**
- **< 10s**: Fast response, excellent user experience
- **10-20s**: Moderate response, acceptable for quality
- **20-30s**: Slower response, consider optimization
- **> 30s**: Slow response, investigate performance issues

### **Success Rate Targets**
- **> 95%**: Excellent reliability
- **90-95%**: Good reliability with occasional failures
- **80-90%**: Acceptable with room for improvement
- **< 80%**: Poor reliability, requires attention

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Quality Issues

### **Low Quality Scores**

If quality scores are consistently low:

1. **Check Specialist Configuration**
   ```python
   # Verify LLM Factory specialists are properly configured
   from llm_factory.specialist_registry import SpecialistRegistry
   registry = SpecialistRegistry()
   print(registry.get_available_specialists())
   ```

2. **Verify Model Selection**
   - Ensure appropriate models are being used
   - Check for model degradation or updates needed

3. **Review Input Quality**
   - Poor input quality leads to poor output quality
   - Validate job descriptions and CV content

### **Slow Response Times**

If response times are consistently high:

1. **Check System Resources**
   - Monitor CPU and memory usage
   - Verify Ollama service performance

2. **Review Model Selection**
   - Consider faster models for non-critical operations
   - Use consensus verification only when necessary

3. **Optimize Prompts**
   - Shorter, more focused prompts process faster
   - Remove unnecessary context

### **Low Success Rates**

If success rates are below 90%:

1. **Check Error Logs**
   ```bash
   # Review LLM Factory logs
   tail -f monitoring/data/llm_factory_metrics.jsonl | grep '"success": false'
   ```

2. **Verify Dependencies**
   - Ensure LLM Factory is properly installed
   - Check Ollama service status

3. **Test Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Verify fallback to original LLM clients works
   - Check graceful degradation paths

# Create daily dashboard script
cat > monitoring/daily_dashboard.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from monitoring.llm_factory_performance_monitor import LLMFactoryPerformanceMonitor

monitor = LLMFactoryPerformanceMonitor()
report = monitor.generate_comprehensive_report(days_back=1)

print(f"📊 Daily LLM Factory Performance")
print(f"Operations: {report['summary']['total_operations']}")
print(f"Quality Improvement: {report['summary']['avg_quality_improvement']:.1f}%")
print(f"Status: {report['summary']['overall_status']}")
EOF

chmod +x monitoring/daily_dashboard.py
```
