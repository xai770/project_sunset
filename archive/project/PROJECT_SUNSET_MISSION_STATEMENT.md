## 🎯 **THE VISION**

Project Sunset is not just another job matching algorithm - it's a **compassionate, intelligent assistant** that meets humans where they are: messy, inconsistent, but ultimately trying their best to find meaningful work.

We're building a system that **helps real people find real jobs**, handling the beautiful chaos of human feedback with sophisticated LLM orchestration while maintaining the warmth and understanding that makes the difference between survival and thriving.

## 🚀 **WHAT PROJECT SUNSET DOES**

### **Core Pipeline:**
1. **🔍 Fetch Jobs** - Intelligently discovers relevant job opportunities
2. **🧠 Run Specialists** - Advanced AI analysis and enrichment via LLM Factory integration  
3. **📊 Create Excel Reports** - Professional, trackable job matching exports
4. **✍️ Generate Cover Letters** - Personalized cover letters for promising positions
5. **📧 Email Delivery** - Seamless delivery to work inbox for review and action

### **The Magic Behind the Scenes:**
- **LLM-First Design**: Never build complex tools when an LLM can do the job
- **Wetbrain-Proof**: Humans are messy, moody, unpredictable - we embrace it
- **Graceful Degradation**: Whatever happens, happens - but we handle it elegantly
- **Local LLM Stability**: Frozen model versions ensure consistent behavior forever

## 📊 **THE EXCEL WORKFLOW SYSTEM**

### **Feedback System Format (A-R Columns)**
```
A-K:  Job Data (URL, description, title, location, etc.)
L:    export_job_matches_log      (Tool 1: timestamp, version, status)
M:    generate_cover_letters_log  (Tool 2: timestamp, generated Y/N, status)
N:    reviewer_feedback           (Human: feedback text when needed)
O:    mailman_log                (Tool 3: timestamp, received, status)
P:    process_feedback_log       (Tool 4: timestamp, action taken, status)
Q:    reviewer_support_log       (Tool 5: clarification emails sent)
R:    workflow_status            (Master status: Exported → CL Generated → Under Review → etc.)
```

### **File Naming Convention**
- **Outbound**: `job_matches_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`
- **Return Email Subject**: `xai job_matches_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`
- **Cover Letters**: `cover_letter_jobID.md`

## 🤖 **INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION**

### **Master Orchestrator LLM**
**Role**: Workflow planner and router  
**Decision Logic**: "Based on this Excel, I need to: generate 3 cover letters, resolve 2 conflicts, send 1 clarification email"

### **Specialized LLM Workers**
1. **Cover Letter Generator** - Creates personalized cover letters for good matches
2. **Conflict Resolver** - Handles contradictory feedback patterns  
3. **Reviewer Support** - Friendly clarification and encouragement
4. **Feedback Analyzer** - Processes feedback to improve future matching

## 🛡️ **WETBRAIN-PROOFING FEATURES**

### **Human-Centric Design**
- **No perfectionist edge cases**: Handle happy path + graceful failure
- **Emotional intelligence**: Encouraging feedback, not judgmental
- **Flexible input**: Accept messy, incomplete, or chaotic feedback  
- **Patient persistence**: Multiple gentle contact attempts before giving up

### **Graceful Degradation**
- **No feedback received**: System continues normally
- **Partial feedback**: Processes available data, ignores gaps
- **Contradictory feedback**: Polite clarification with fallback
- **Multiple Excel versions**: Processes incrementally, detects conflicts intelligently
