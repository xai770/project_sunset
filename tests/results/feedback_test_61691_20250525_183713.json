The user feedback indicates that the CV shows experience in all required domain-specific areas, which is a crucial factor for a Good match level. However, the system's assessment focuses on the lack of specific experience with UK/EU VAT regulations and mentions the absence of tax systems outside the UK/Germany as desirable.\nThis discrepancy may be due to the system's emphasis on breadth of knowledge over depth of experience in specific domains. The system's prompt might prioritize general technical skills over domain-specific requirements, leading to an underestimation of the candidate's fit for the job.",
        "recommendations": "\n1. Adjust the prompt to emphasize both breadth and depth of experience in required domain-specific areas. This could be achieved by adding a weightage factor in the matching logic that gives more importance to domain-specific experience.\n2. Enhance the system's assessment criteria to include a more nuanced evaluation of candidates' experiences, taking into account both general technical knowledge and specific domain expertise.\n3. Implement a feedback loop where users can provide more detailed explanations for their assessments, which can help the system refine its understanding of what constitutes a Good match level.",
