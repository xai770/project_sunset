# Project Sunset - Frankfurt Pipeline Investigation & Recovery
## June 12, 2025

## 📋 Investigation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

This investigation addressed critical issues in the Frankfurt job search pipeline and implemented a comprehensive self-healing recovery system.

## 🔍 Issues Identified & Resolved

### ✅ 1. Cover Letter Generation Fixed

- **Result**: Cover letter generation now works perfectly

### ✅ 2. Missing Job Files Recovery
- **Issue**: 37 jobs (39%) marked as processed but missing files
- **Root Cause**: Gap between API success and file saving
- **Solution**: Built automatic recovery system
- **Result**: Recovered 20/37 jobs, reduced missing rate to 18%

### ✅ 3. Self-Healing Pipeline Integration
- **Enhancement**: Added automatic recovery to main and daily pipelines
- **Features**: Configurable limits, smart prioritization, comprehensive logging
- **Result**: Pipeline now automatically maintains data completeness
