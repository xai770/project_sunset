**Step 1:** Scan skill categories for named projects that demonstrate role requirements
**Step 2:** Check Industry Experience Context for domain alignment  
**Step 3:** Determine match level using these criteria:

- **Low match:** Missing direct evidence for key requirements (e.g., role needs tax experience, inventory shows only IT experience)
- **Moderate match:** Transferable skills present but gaps in secondary requirements  
- **Good match:** Direct project evidence for all major requirements

## 2. Output Requirements

Provide exactly one of the following based on match level:

### Good Match → Application Narrative
One paragraph referencing specific named projects with quantified achievements.

**Example:** "My experience leading the Software Escrow Management Project demonstrates regulatory compliance expertise across multiple jurisdictions. Working with legal teams and regulatory stakeholders to establish governance frameworks directly parallels the process improvement required for this role. Additionally, the €12M+ IBM Outsourcing Deal showcases my ability to manage large-scale compliance projects."

### Moderate/Low Match → No-go Rationale  
**Example:** "I have compared my Skills Inventory and the role description and decided not to apply due to the following reasons: the role requires specialized tax advisory experience while my background focuses on software compliance, creating too significant a gap to bridge effectively."

## 3. Required Format

**Match Level:** [Low match/Moderate match/Good match]
