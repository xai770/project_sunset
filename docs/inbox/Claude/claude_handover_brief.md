## Project Context (30 seconds)

**JMFS** = Job Finding and Matching System for brutal job market survival
- **Started:** Sunday, functional by Wednesday (AI-assisted rapid development)
- **Mission:** Help people survive job search crisis with systematic advantage
- **Approach:** Revolutionary cover letters are minimum viable excellence, not over-engineering

## Current Status

### **What's Working**
- ‚úÖ Job scraping and matching pipeline (61 jobs processed, all "Low" matches)
- ‚úÖ Excel export with professional formatting
- ‚úÖ LLM evaluation using conservative 5-run approach
- ‚úÖ PNG chart generation (ASCII removed per assessment)

### **In Development**
- üîÑ Revolutionary cover letter features (skill timelines, quantifiable achievements)
- üîÑ 3-LLM consensus method for quality control
- üîÑ 32GB workstation setup for advanced processing

### **Next Milestone**
- üéØ End-to-end cover letter generation with HR manager testing

## Key Agreements (Don't Re-argue These)

1. **"Ferrari vs Bicycle"**: Revolutionary features are necessary for brutal job market
2. **Technical approach**: Modular system with feature flags, not MVP stripping
3. **Market focus**: German compliance + helping people survive unemployment
4. **Competition**: Welcome big tech copying us - validates market
5. **Business model**: ‚Ç¨19-49/month justified for survival tool value

## Critical Context

### **Hardware**
- Current: 6GB VRAM gaming laptop (sufficient for pilot)
- Available: 32GB VRAM workstation for LLM consensus
- Strategy: Local processing for pilot, cloud hybrid later

### **Team Dynamics**
- **xai**: Strategy, user needs, real-world testing
- **Claude**: Analysis, planning, quality review
- **Copilot**: Implementation, architecture, technical execution

### **No Good Matches Problem**
- All 61 jobs legitimately "Low" matches (xai is 60, overqualified/underqualified)
- Need artificial "Good" matches to test cover letter pipeline
- This validates matching accuracy, not system failure

## What To Ask About (Skip Background)

### **Progress Updates**
- "How's the LLM consensus implementation going?"
- "Any HR manager feedback yet?"
- "Technical issues with PNG chart integration?"
- "Beta user testing with Mysti?"

### **Technical Focus**
- LLM orchestration framework status
- Cover letter pipeline integration
- 32GB workstation utilization
- Feature flag implementation

### **Market Validation**
- HR manager testing results
- User feedback integration
- Compliance documentation effectiveness

## What NOT To Discuss (Already Resolved)

- ‚ùå Whether revolutionary features are over-engineering
- ‚ùå Stripping back to basic MVP
- ‚ùå Competition concerns from LinkedIn/Indeed
- ‚ùå Business model viability for job seekers
- ‚ùå ASCII charts (removed)
- ‚ùå Multiple chart formats (standardized on PNG)

## Recent Assessment Conclusions

- System architecture is sound with incremental improvements planned
- Market validation is priority, not theoretical concerns
- Three-way AI collaboration is working exceptionally well
- Focus on helping real people, not building perfect product

## Key Files & Context

- `claude2claude_welcome_letter.md` - Detailed project history
- `jfms_str_vision.md` - Strategic foundation
- `default_prompt.py` - Current working LLM evaluation prompt
- Revolutionary cover letter demos in output/cover_letters/

## Quick Start for New Sessions

**Ask:** "What's the latest on [specific component]? Any blockers?"  
**Don't ask:** "Should we simplify the approach?" (Answer: No, we already decided)

**Focus on:** Execution details, technical implementation, user feedback  
**Skip:** Strategy debates, market validation theory, competition analysis
