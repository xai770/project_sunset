# Skill Domain Relationship Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

We've identified a critical issue with the current skill matching system: broad, generic skills like "automation" are matching with many unrelated requirements, leading to false positives in job matches. For example:

- Your generic "automation" skill is matching with specialized requirements like "Deployment Automation (CI/CD)" and "Test Automation Framework Development"
- This creates artificially high match scores (currently 100%) for jobs that actually require specialized knowledge you may not possess
- With semantic matching disabled, we've reduced false positives, but we need a better approach than simply turning off matching altogether

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Semantic similarity** alone is insufficient for skill matching - it relies too much on textual similarity rather than conceptual relationships
2. **Domain context** is missing - the system doesn't understand that "automation" in different domains means very different things
3. **Knowledge component overlap** isn't being considered - the detailed knowledge required for specific automation tasks varies dramatically
4. **Proficiency levels** aren't differentiated - general familiarity vs. deep expertise aren't distinguished

## Proposed Solution: Implement the Skill Domain Relationship Framework

We'll implement the SDR framework outlined in `skill-domain-relationship-framework.md` to provide more nuanced and accurate skill matching.

### Phase 1: Skill Domain Definition (Target: May 10, 2025)

1. **Skill Enrichment**
   - Add domain information to each skill in your profile
   - Define knowledge components for each skill
   - Specify contexts where each skill is applied
   - Assign proficiency levels (1-10 scale)

2. **Focus on Problem Skills**
   - Begin with "automation" and other generic skills causing false matches
   - Create specialized sub-skills with proper domain contexts
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "general_automation",
       "name": "Basic Process Automation",
       "knowledge_components": ["workflow_analysis", "basic_scripting", "process_improvement"],
       "context": ["office", "business_process"],
       "proficiency_level": 6,
       "function": ["efficiency_improvement", "task_simplification"]
     }
     ```

### Phase 2: Relationship Classification (Target: May 15, 2025) ✅

1. **Implement Core Functions** ✅
   - Jaccard similarity calculation
   - Skill distance metrics
   - Relationship classification algorithms
   - Modular implementation with clear separation of concerns

2. **Initial Testing** ✅
   - Test with known problematic skills (like "automation")
   - Verify that relationships are correctly classified
   - Fine-tune thresholds for different relationship types

### Phase 3: Integration with Matching System (Target: May 20, 2025)

1. **Modify Matching Algorithm**
   - Replace or enhance semantic matching with domain-aware matching
   - Implement stronger filtering based on relationship types
   - Consider only relevant relationships (subset, neighboring, etc.)

2. **Update `find_skill_matches` function**
   - Add domain relationship checking
   - Adjust match strength based on relationship type
   - Keep semantic matching disabled by default

### Phase 4: LLM-Enhanced Domain Analysis (Target: May 25, 2025) ✅

1. **Implement Domain Extraction** ✅
   - Use LLM to extract domain components for job requirements
   - Generate knowledge components, contexts, and functions

2. **Relationship Analysis** ✅
   - Use LLM to analyze relationships between job requirements and your skills
   - Calculate real compatibility percentages
   - Provide transition paths for skill gaps

## LLM Integration Strategy

### Available Models Testing (as of May 8, 2025)

We have conducted comprehensive testing across multiple models to determine the optimal combination of accuracy, reliability, and performance. The updated results include:

| Model | Performance | JSON Quality | Response Time | Reliability | Overall Rating |
|-------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| llama3.2 | Very Good | Excellent | 25-40s | Good (occasional timeouts) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| phi4-mini-reasoning | Good | Good | 15-25s | Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| mistral | Good | Very Good | 18-30s | Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| deepseek-r1 | Very Good | Good | 22-35s | Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| gemma3 | Good | Good | 15-28s | Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| hermes3 | Fair | Good | 20-32s | Fair | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| dolphin3 | Fair | Good | 19-30s | Fair | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| command-r7b | Fair | Fair | 15-25s | Good | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| olmo2 | Poor | Fair | 15-25s | Good | ⭐⭐ |
| openthinker | Poor | Poor | 15-25s | Fair | ⭐⭐ |
| deepscaler | Good | Good | 30-45s | Poor (frequent timeouts) | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| exaone-deep | Good | Very Good | 35-50s | Poor (frequent timeouts) | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| cogito | Fair | Fair | 18-30s | Fair | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| qwen3 | Good | Good | 20-32s | Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| llama3.1 | Good | Good | 22-35s | Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Based on our comprehensive testing, we've identified **phi4-mini-reasoning** as our primary model for domain extraction and relationship analysis, with **llama3.2** and **mistral** as fallback options. The phi4 model offers the best balance of speed, reliability, and quality for our specific use case.

### Model Selection Insights

Our testing revealed several important considerations for model selection in domain analysis tasks:

1. **JSON Structure Compliance**
   - phi4-mini-reasoning and llama3.2 consistently produce well-structured JSON with all required fields
   - Several models (openthinker, cogito) frequently generated malformed JSON requiring additional parsing logic

2. **Domain Knowledge Accuracy**
   - llama3.2 and deepseek-r1 demonstrated superior understanding of technical domains
   - phi4-mini-reasoning showed excellent balance between accuracy and response time
   - Smaller models struggled with nuanced differentiations between similar domains

3. **Reliability and Timeout Handling**
   - phi4-mini-reasoning had the fewest timeouts even with complex queries
   - Larger models (deepscaler, exaone-deep) frequently timed out despite having good knowledge
   - Our improved timeout handling with exponential backoff has significantly reduced failures

4. **Batch Processing Performance**
   - phi4-mini-reasoning can process approximately 10-15 skills per minute
   - This represents a 3x improvement over our previous implementation using llama3.2 only
