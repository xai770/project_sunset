      "prompt": "Extract ONLY the English version of this job description from Deutsche Bank.\n\nYour task is to identify and extract a clean, professional English-only version of this job posting. \n\nPlease follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. IMPORTANT: Many job postings contain both German and English sections. If a section only exists in German, DO NOT include it. Only extract content that is already in English.\n\n2. IF the job posting has NO English version (i.e., it's only in German): Return ONLY the job title, location, job ID, and any other basic metadata in English. Add a note: '[This job posting is only available in German]'\n\n3. ALWAYS CHECK FOR AN ENGLISH SECTION: Deutsche Bank job postings typically have an English version after a divider line (_________) or under headings like 'Details of the role', 'Your key responsibilities', etc.\n\n4. Remove all HTML tags, formatting codes, and excess whitespace. Make sure there are no <span> or other HTML elements in the output.\n\n5. Do not include company culture/values, benefits sections, or marketing content. Focus only on the core job information.\n\n6. Maintain the exact wording of the job title, responsibilities, requirements, and location information as written in English. Never modify this content.\n\n7. Preserve the original structure with headings and bullet points for the job description.\n\n8. Include relevant contact information at the end.\n\n9. Final check: Verify that NO GERMAN TEXT remains in your output. If you find any German text, remove it completely.\n\nThe final output should be a clean, professional job description in English only, containing just the essential information about the position.",
